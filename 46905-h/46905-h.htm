</span>
ebster, along with thousands
of other lusty forward-looking
Kentucky
children, went to the
crowded public schools.</p>

<p>There every morning against his will
but with the connivance of his parents
he was made a prisoner, as it seemed
to him, and for long hours held as such
while many things disagreeable or unnecessary,
some by one teacher and
some by another, were forced into his
head. Soon after they were forced in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
most of the things disappeared from
the head. What became of them nobody
knew: Webster didn't know and
he didn't care. During the forcing-in
process month by month and year by
year he now and then picked up a
pleasant idea for himself, some wonderful
idea about great things on ahead in
life or about the tempting world just
outside school. He picked up such
ideas with ease and eagerness and held
on to them.</p>

<p>He lived in a small white-frame cottage
which was rather new but already
looked rather old. It stood in a small
green yard, which was naturally very
old but still looked young. The still-young
yard and the already-ageing
cottage were to be found&mdash;should anybody
have tried to find them&mdash;on the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
rim of the city. If the architectural
plan of the city had been mapped out
as an open-air theatre, the cottage
would have been a rear seat in the very
last row at the very lowest price. The
block was made up of such cottages&mdash;rear
seats. They faced the city but
couldn't see the city, couldn't see anything
worth seeing, and might as well
have looked in some other direction or
not looked at all.</p>

<p>If Webster stepped out of the front
door, he was within five yards of the
outmost thoroughfare&mdash;native dirt-road
for milk wagons, butchers' wagons,
coal carts, and fruit-and-berry
wagons. Webster's father kept an
especial eye on the coal carts: they
weighed heavily on his salary. Webster's
mother kept her eye on the fruit-and-berry
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
wagons: they tantalised her
passion for preserves. Everybody
kept uneasy eyes on milk and butchers'
and vegetable wagons, which brought
expensive satisfaction to appetites for
three meals a day. The edges of the
thoroughfare were paths for the cottagers,
all of whom walked and were
glad and grateful even to be able to
walk. The visitors of the cottagers
walked. Everybody walked but the
drivers. The French would have called
the street The Avenue of Soles.</p>

<p>One wet winter morning as Webster,
walking beside his father, lifted his
feet out of the mud and felt sorry about
their shoes, he complained because
there was no pavement.</p>

<p>"My son," replied his father, whose
remarks on any subject appeared to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
come out of a clear sky, so unclouded
were they by uncertainty, "my son,
your father's salary is not a paved-sidewalk
salary. The mud on your
shoes is in an inverse ratio to the funds
in his pockets. I believe you have
learned in your arithmetic at school by
this time what ratio is."</p>

<p>One dry summer morning as Webster
walked beside his father, a butcher's
wagon whirled past and covered
them quickly with dust. He considered
this injury to their best clothes
and complained because there was no
watering-cart.</p>

<p>"My son," replied his father out of
his daily clear sky, "my salary is not a
watering-cart salary. The presence of
the earth's dust in your eyes exactly
equals the lack of gold-dust in your
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
father's earthly account. I believe by
this time you have studied equations."</p>

<p>But if Webster had stepped out of the
back door of the cottage and passed
under the clothes-line which was held
up at its middle point by a forked pole,
if he had crossed their very small vegetable
garden and then had crossed a wide
deep cow-lot where some rich man of
the city pastured his fat milk cows, he
would have been on the edge of the
country. It was possible for one standing
on the rear porch to see all summer
thick, softly waving woods.</p>

<p>Within the past two or three years,
as summer had come again and the
world turned green, a change had taken
place in Webster, a growth. More and
more he began to look from the porch
or windows at those distant massed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
trees. Something from them seemed
to cross over to him, an influence powerful
and compelling; it drew him out
of the house back with it into the mystery
of the forest and he never returned.</p>

<p>In truth, almost as soon as he could
go anywhere he had started toward the
forest without asking permission. They
had overtaken him then and dragged
him back. When he was old enough
to understand, they had explained:
he was too young, he would get lost,
the bull would hook him.</p>

<p>"But why?" Webster had asked,
complaining of this new injustice in
the world. He was perpetually being
surprised that so many things in the
world were bent on getting one into
trouble; all around him things seemed
to be waiting to make trouble. "Why
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
should the bull hook <i>me</i>? <i>I've</i> done
nothing to <i>the bull</i>."</p>

<p>They were about finishing breakfast.
He was eating in his slow ruminant
way&mdash;he ate enormously but never
hungrily. His father, whose custom it
was to divide the last half of his breakfast
with the first half of his newspaper,
lowered the paper and looked
over the top.</p>

<p>"My son," he said, "the bull has
horns. Every living creature is bound
to use everything it has. Use what
you have or lose what you have&mdash;that
is the terrible law in this world. Therefore
the bull is obliged to hook what
he can to keep his horns going. If you
give him the chance, he will practise
them on you. Otherwise his great-great-grandson
might not have any
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
horns when he really needed them.
Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"No," said Webster.</p>

<p>"I'll explain again when you are
mature enough to comprehend," said
his father, returning to his paper.</p>

<p>Webster returned to the subject.</p>

<p>"If I ever have any money in my
pocket, you always tell me not to spend
it: now you say I ought to use whatever
I have."</p>

<p>His father quickly lowered his paper
and raised his voice:</p>

<p>"I have never said that you must
use everything all at once, my son.
You must learn to use it at the right
time."</p>

<p>"When <i>is</i> the right time to use a
thing?" asked Webster, eating quietly
on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll answer that question when it
is necessary," his father replied grumblingly
from behind his paper, putting
an end to the disturbance.</p>

<p>A few weeks prior to this breakfast-scene
Webster one day at recess had
laid bare a trouble in himself, confiding
it to one of his intimate school-mates.
He did so with a tone of uncertainty,
for he was not sure but he was not
being disloyal.</p>

<p>"Can <i>your</i> father answer all the
questions <i>you</i> ask <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p>"Not half of them!" exclaimed the
comrade with splendid candour&mdash;"Not
half!"</p>

<p>"My father answers very few <i>I</i> ask
<i>him</i>," interposed a fragile little white-faced
fellow who had strolled up in
time to catch the drift of the confidential
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
talk. He did not appear strong
enough even to put a question: he
nursed a ragged ball, had lost a front
tooth, and gave off the general skim-milk
look which some children carry
about with them.</p>

<p>Webster, without inquiring further,
began to feel a new respect for himself
as not being worse off than other boys
as to fathers; also a new respect for
his father as not being worse than his
class: fathers were deficient!</p>

<p>Remembering this discovery at
school&mdash;one of the big pleasant ideas
he picked up outside lessons&mdash;he did
not on the morning in question press
his father more closely as to using horns
when you have them and not using
money when you have it. In fact, he
was already beginning to shield his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
father and had quite ceased to interrogate
him in company, lest he expose
some ignorance. He therefore credited
this incident where it belonged: as a
part of his growing knowledge that he
couldn't look to his father for any great
help on things that puzzled him&mdash;fathers,
as had been said, being deficient,
though always contriving to look
so proficient that from merely surveying
them you would never suspect the
truth.</p>

<p>Webster's father was a minor bookkeeper
in one of the city's minor banks.
Like his bankbooks, he was always
perfectly balanced, perfectly behaved;
and he was also perfectly bald. Even
his baldness might have been credited
to him as one of the triumphs of exact
calculation: the baldness of one side
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
being exactly equal to the baldness of
the other: hardly a hair on either exposure
stood out as an unaccounted-for
remainder.</p>

<p>Webster thought of his father as
having worked at nothing but arithmetic
for nearly forty years. Sometimes
it became a kind of disgust to
him to remember this: as was his
custom when displeased at anything
he grew contemptuous. In one of his
contemptuous moments he one day
asked:</p>

<p>"How many times have you made
the figure 2?"</p>

<p>"Three quadrillion times, my son,"
replied his father with perfect accuracy
and a spirit of hourly freshness. His
father went on:</p>

<p>"The same number of times for all
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
of them. When you're in the thousands,
you may think one or the other
figure is ahead, but when you get
well on into the millions, there isn't
any difference: they are neck and
neck."</p>

<p>This subject of arithmetic was the
sorest that father and son could have
broached: perhaps that was the reason
why neither could get away from it.
The family lived on arithmetic or off
it&mdash;had married on it, were born unto
it, were fed by it, housed and heated
by it, ventilated and cooled by it.
Webster's father's knowledge of arithmetic
had marched at the head of the
family as they made their way through
time and trouble like music. It had
been a lifelong bugle-blast of correct
numerals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence the terrible disappointment:
after Webster had been at school long
enough for grading to begin to come
home as to what faculties he possessed
and the progress he made, his parents
discovered to their terror and shame
that he was good in nothing and least
good in arithmetic. It was like a
child's turning against his own bread
and butter and shirt and shoes. To his
father it meant a clear family breakdown.
The moment had come to him
which, in unlike ways, comes to many
a father when he feels obliged to say:
"This is no son of mine."</p>

<p>In reality, Webster's father had
had somewhat that feeling from the
first. When summoned and permitted,
he had tipped into the room on the day
of Webster's birth and taken a father's
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
anxious defensive look. He had turned
off with a gesture of repudiation but of
the deepest respect:</p>

<p>"No such head and countenance ever
descended to him from me! We must
be square with him from the start! I
place to his credit the name of Daniel
Webster. His mother, instead of admiring
her husband, had been gazing
too fondly at the steel engraving of the
statesman over the mantelpiece in the
parlour."</p>

<p>When Webster was several years old,
one day during a meal&mdash;nobody knew
just what brought forth the question&mdash;he
asked:</p>

<p>"Why was I named Webster?"</p>

<p>His father answered:</p>

<p>"Because you looked like him."</p>

<p>Webster got up quietly and went
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
into the parlour and quietly returned
to his seat at table:</p>

<p>"No, I don't look like him," he said.</p>

<p>"You looked like him the day you
were born, my son. Any resemblance
to Daniel Webster is apt to become less
and less. Finally, you don't look like
him any more. In the United States
Senate nowadays, for instance, there
isn't a trace of resemblance left anywhere.
Senators at present look more
like me and you know what that means:
it means that nobody need feel obliged
to think of Daniel Webster!"</p>

<p>That birthday jest&mdash;that he was
not quite entitled to the nativity of
his own son, an uneasiness perhaps inherited
by fathers from the rudimentary
marriages of primitive society&mdash;was
but a jest then. It gradually took
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
on serious meaning as his son grew
further away from him with each
year of growth. The bad passing
of the arithmetic milestone had
brought the worst distinct shock.
Still, even that left Webster's father
perfectly balanced, perfectly behaved:
he remained proud of his unlike offspring,
fed and clothed him, and was
fond of him.</p>

<p>There is a bare possibility also that
in Webster he saw the only chance to
risk part of his salary in secret speculation.
Nearly everybody in the town
gambled on something. The bank did
not favour the idea that its employees
should enjoy any such monetary
pastime. But even a bank cannot
prevent a father from betting on his
own son if he keeps the indiscretion
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to himself. Thus it is barely possible
that, in the language of the country,
Webster's father took chances on Webster
as a winning colt on some unknown
track, if he should ever take a notion
to run! Why not bet, if it cost the
same as not to bet: at least you had
the excitement?</p>

<p>Webster on his part grew more and
more into the belief that his father not
only could not answer his questions
but&mdash;what was of far greater consequence&mdash;did
not open up before him
any path in life. His first natural and
warm desire had been to imitate his
father, to follow in his footsteps: slowly
he discovered that his father did not
have any footsteps, he made no path.
His affection still encircled his father
like a pair of arms; his eyes had completely
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
abandoned him as a sign-post
on life's road.</p>

<p>Mothers often open up roads for
their sons or point them out, but Webster
could not look to his mother for
one unless he had wished to take a
short road to an uneventful past. The
kind of a mother she was resulted from
the kind of a wife she was. She had
taken her husband's arm at marriage
to keep step at his side through life.
Had he moved forward, she would have
moved forward. Since he did not advance,
but in his life-work represented
a kind of perpetual motion without
progress, she stayed by him and busied
herself with multifarious daily little
motions of her own. Her roadless life
had one main path of memory. That
led her backward to a large orchard and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
garden and yard out in the country,
filled with fruit trees and berry-bearing
bushes and vines. She, now a middle-aged
wife and mother, was a sentimental
calendar of far-away things "just
ripe." The procession of fruit-and-berry
wagons past the cottage from
May to October had upon her the
effect of an acute exacerbation of this
chronic lament. The street cry of a
vendor, no matter how urgent her duty
anywhere in the cottage at the moment,
brought her to a front window
or to the front porch or even swept her
out to the front gate, to gratify her
eyes with memories and pay her respects
to the impossible. She inquired
the cost of so much and bought so little
that the drivers, who are keen and unfavourable
judges of human nature,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
when they met at cross streets and
compared notes&mdash;the disappointed, exasperated
drivers named her <i>Mrs. Price</i>:
though one insisted upon calling her
<i>Lady Not-Today</i>. Whenever at the bottom
of her pocketbook she found spare
change for a box of brilliant, transparent
red cherries, she bore it into the
cottage as rapaciously as some miser
of jewels might have carried off a casket
of rubies. Thus you could almost
have said that Webster had been born
of arithmetic and preserves. Still, his
life with his father and mother was
wholesome and affectionate and peaceful&mdash;an
existence bounded by the horizon
of the day.</p>

<p>His boyhood certainly had no wide
field of vision, no distant horizon, as regards
his sleeping quarters. In building
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the cottage a bathroom on the first
floor had been added to one side of it
as a last luxurious afterthought. If
you stood before the cottage and looked
it squarely in the face, the bathroom
protruded on one side like a badly
swollen jaw. The building-plan when
worked out, had involved expense beyond
the calculation, as usually happens,
and this had threatened the Salary:
the extra bath, therefore, remained
unrealised. Webster always asked at
least one question about everything
new and untried, and when old enough
to be put there to sleep, he had looked
around the cramped enclosure and inquired
why it had been built. Thus
he learned that in the family he had
now taken the place of the Bath That
Failed. It caused him a queer feeling
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
as to his general repute in the neighbourhood
that the very sight of him
might bring to any observer's mind
thoughts of a missing tub.</p>

<p>His window opened upon a few feet
of yard. Just over the fence was the
kitchen window of the cottage next in
the row. When that window was open,
Webster had to see the kitchen table
and the preparation for meals. He
violently disliked the sight of the preparations.
If the window was closed,
tidings as to what was going on reached
him through another sense; his bedroom-bathroom
became as a whispering
gallery of cooking odours. But
their own kitchen was just across a
narrow hall, and fragrances from it
occasionally mingled with those from
the kitchen over the fence. Made
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
hungry by nasal intelligence of something
appetising, Webster would sometimes
hurriedly dress and follow his
pointer into the breakfast room, only
to find that he was on a false trail:
what he had expected to get his share
of was being consumed by the family
next door. He no longer had confidence,
so to speak, in his own nose&mdash;not
as a leading authority on meals to
be eaten by him.</p>

<p>One beautiful use his window had,
one glorious use, one enchantment. In
the depth of winter sometimes of mornings
when he got out of bed and went
to open the shutter, on the window
panes would be a forest of glittering
trees. The first time he beheld such a
forest, he stood before it spell-bound:
wondering whether there were silvery
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
birds singing far off amid the silvery
boughs and what wild frost-creatures
crouched in the tall stiff frost-grass.
From the ice-forests on his window
panes his thoughts always returned to
the green summer forest on the distant
horizon.</p>

<p>The pest of his existence at home was
Elinor&mdash;a year younger but much older
in her ways: to Webster she was as old
as Mischief, as old as Evil. For Elinor
had early fastened herself upon his existence
as a tease. She laughed at
him, ridiculed his remarks, especially
when he thought them wise, dragged
down everything in him. As they sat
at table and he launched out upon any
subject with his father&mdash;quite in the
manner of one gentleman indulging his
intellect with another gentleman over
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
their rich viands&mdash;Elinor went away up
into a little gallery of her own and
tried to boo him off the stage. His
father and mother did not at times conceal
their amusement at Elinor's boo's.
He sometimes broke out savagely at
her, which only made her worse. His
mother, who was not without gentle
firmness and a saving measure of good
sense, one day disapproved of his temper
and remarked advisedly to him,
Elinor having fled after a victory over
him:</p>

<p>"Elinor teases you because she sees
that it annoys you. She ought to
keep on teasing you till you stop being
annoyed. When she sees that she
can't tease you, she'll stop trying."</p>

<p>That was all very well: but one day
he teased Elinor. She puckered up and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
began to cry and his mother said
quickly:</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Webster."</p>

<p>Then besides: a few years before he
had one day overheard his mother persuading
his father that Elinor must
not be sent to the public school.</p>

<p>"I want her to go to a private school.
She has such a difficult disposition, it
will require delicate attention. The
teachers haven't time to give her that
patient attention in the public schools."</p>

<p>"My dear," Elinor's father had replied,
shaking his head, "your husband's
salary is not a private-school
salary. It also has a difficult disposition,
it also requires the most careful
watching!"</p>

<p>"The cost will be more but she must
go. Some extra expense will be unavoidable
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
even for her clothing but
I'll take that out of <i>my</i> clothes."</p>

<p>"You will do nothing of the kind! If
Elinor has a difficult disposition, she
gets it from Elinor's father; for <i>he</i> had
one once, thank God! He had it until
he went into the bank. But a bank
takes every kind of disposition out of
you, good or bad. After you've been
in a bank so many years, you haven't
any more disposition. Only the president
of a bank enjoys the right to have
a disposition. All the rest of us are
mere habits&mdash;certain habits on uncertain
salaries. Let Elinor go to her
select school and I'll go a little more
ragged. The outside world thinks it a
bank joke when they look through the
windows and see bank clerks at work
in ragged coats: instead they know better.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Let Elinor go and let the damages
fall on her father. He will be glad to
take the extra cost off his own back as
a tribute to his unbanked boyhood. I
hope you noticed my pun&mdash;my dooble
intender."</p>

<p>Thus Elinor was sent to the most
select private school of the city. Webster
weighed the matter on the scales
of boyish justice. If you had a bad
disposition, you were rewarded by being
better dressed and being sent to the
best school; if you had a good disposition,
you dressed plainly and went to
the public school. What ought he to do
about his own disposition? Why not
turn it into a bad one? It was among
Webster's bewilderments that he was
so poorly off as not to be able to muster
a troublesome enough disposition to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
be sent to one of the city's select
private schools for boys: he should
very much have liked to go!</p>

<p>"I go to a private school because I
am <i>nice</i>," Elinor had boasted to him
one morning. She was sitting on the
front steps as he came out on his way
to school, and she looked very dainty
and very charming&mdash;a dark, wiry, fiery,
restless little creature, and at the moment
a bit of brilliant decoration. "And
I get nice marks," she added pointedly.</p>

<p>He paused to make a quietly contemptuous
reply.</p>

<p>"Of course you get nice marks: that's
what private schools are for&mdash;to give
everybody nice marks. If you went to
the public school, you'd get what you
deserved."</p>

<p>"Then you seem to deserve very
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
little," said Elinor, smoothing a lock
of her black hair over one ear.</p>

<p>His rage burst out at her deadly
thrust:</p>

<p>"You go to a private school because
you are a little devil," he said.</p>

<p>"Why don't you be a little devil
too?" inquired Elinor, her bright eyes
mocking him. "Can't you be a little
devil too?"</p>

<p>He jerked the strap tighter around
his battered books:</p>

<p>"If you were in the public schools,
they wouldn't put up with you. They'd
send you home or they'd break you
in."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Elinor,
with an encouraging smile, "they seem
to get along with you very well."</p>

<p>Webster knew that Elinor's teasing,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
ridiculing eyes followed him as he
walked away. They became part of
the things that cheapened him in his
life. When he had passed through the
front gate, he started off in a direction
which was not the direction to school.</p>

<p>Elinor sang out shrilly:</p>

<p>"I know where you are going. But
it's of no use. Jenny's sweetheart goes
to a private school and he stands well
in his classes."</p>

<p>He walked on, but turned his face
toward her:</p>

<p>"It's none of <i>your</i> meddlesome business,
you little black scorpion," he said
quietly.</p>

<p>With an upward bound of his nature
he thought of Jenny, a very different
sort of girl.</p>

<p>Jenny lived in the largest cottage of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the block, at the better of the two corners.
The families visited intimately.
Jenny's father was a coal merchant and
Webster's father bought his coal of
Jenny's father. A grocer lived in the
middle of the block: he bought supplies
from that grocer. "If you can," he
said, "deal with your neighbours. It
will make them more careful: they
won't dare ...!" On the contrary,
Jenny's father did not deposit his
cheques in Webster's father's bank.
"Don't do your business with a neighbour,"
he said. "Neighbours pry."</p>

<p>Jenny represented in Webster's life
the masculine awakening of his nature
toward womankind. In the white light
of that general dawn, she stood revealed
but not recognised. A little
thing had happened, the summer previous,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
which was of common interest
to them. In a corner of Jenny's yard
grew a locust tree, not a full forest-sized
locust tree but still quite a respectable
locust tree for its place and
advantages. All around the trunk and
up the trunk clambered the trumpet-vine.
Several yards from the earth
some of the branches bent over and
spread out as a roof for a little arbour&mdash;Jenny's
summer play-house.</p>

<p>One dewy morning Jenny had first
noticed a humming-bird hovering about
the blossoms. She did not know that
it was the ruby-throat, seeking the
trumpet-vine where Audubon painted
him. She only knew that she was excited
and delighted. She told Webster.</p>

<p>"If he comes back, run and tell me,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
will you, Jenny?" he pleaded, with
some strange new joy in him. Several
times she had run and summoned him;
and the two children, unconsciously
drawing nearer to each other, and hand
in hand watched the ruby-throat hovering
about the adopted flower of the
State.</p>

<p>The distant green forest and the
locust tree with the trumpet-vine and
the humming-bird&mdash;these, though distant
from one another, became in
Webster's mind part of something
deep and powerful in his life, toward
which he was moving.</p>

<p>If no road opened before him at
home, none opened at school. He
would gladly have quit any day. He
tried to make lessons appear worse
than they were in order to justify himself
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
in his philosophy of contempt and
rejection.</p>

<p>When any two old ladies met on the
street, he argued, they did not begin
to parse as fast as possible at each other.
Old gentlemen of the city did not walk
up and down with books glued to their
noses, trying to memorise things they
would rather forget. When people
went to the library for delightful books
to read, nobody took home arithmetics
and geographies. There wasn't a
grown person in the city who cared
what bounded Indiana on the north
or if all the creeks in Maine emptied
into the mouths of school teachers. In
church, when the minister climbed to
the pulpit, the congregation didn't begin
to examine him in history. They
didn't even examine him in the Bible;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
he couldn't have stood the examination
if they had. In the court-room,
at the fair, at the races, at the theatre,
when you were born, when you were
playing, when you had a sweetheart,
when you married, when you were a
father, when you were sick, when you
were in any way happy or unhappy,
when you were dying, when you were
dead and buried and forgotten, nobody
called for school books.</p>

<p>Webster, nevertheless, both at home
and at school made his impression. No
one could have defined the nature of
the impression but every one knew he
made it. If he failed at his lessons, his
teachers were not angry; they looked
mortified and said as little as possible
and all the while pushed him along by
hook or crook, until at last they had
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
smuggled him into high school&mdash;the
final heaven of the whole torment.</p>

<p>The impression upon his school fellows
was likewise strongly in his favour.
Toward the close of each session there
was intense struggle and strain for the
highest mark in class and the next
highest and the next. When the nerve-racking
race was over and everybody
had time to look around and inquire
for Webster, they could see him cantering
quietly down the home stretch,
unmindful of the good-natured jeers
that greeted his arrival: he had gone
over the course, he had not run. As
soon as they were out of doors in a
game, Webster stepped to the front.
Those who had just outstripped him
now followed him.</p>

<p>Roadless parents&mdash;a child looking
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
for its road in life! That is Nature's
plan to stop imitation, to block the
roads of parents to their children, and
force these into new paths for the development
of the individual and of
the race. And in what other country
is that spectacle so common as in our
American democracy, where progress
is so swift and the future so vast and
untrod and untried that nearly every
generation in thousands of cottages
represents a revolt and a revolution of
children against their parents, their
work and their ways? But Webster's
father and mother were not philosophers
as to how Nature works out her
plan through our American democracy:
they merely had their parental
apprehensions and confidentially discussed
these. What would Webster
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
be, would he ever be anything? He
would finish at high school this year
and it was time to decide.</p>

<p>A son of the grocer in the block had
made an unexpected upward stride in
life and surprised all the cottagers.
Webster's father and mother took care
to bring this meritorious example to
their son's attention.</p>

<p>"What are <i>you</i> going to be, Webster?"
his mother asked one morning
at breakfast, looking understandingly
at Webster's father.</p>

<p>"I don't know what I'm going to
be," Webster had replied unconcernedly.
"I know I'm not going to be
what <i>he</i> is!"</p>

<p>"It would never do to try to force
him," his father said later. "Not <i>him</i>.
Besides, think of a couple of American
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
parents undertaking to force their
children to do anything&mdash;<i>any</i> children!
We'll have to wait a while longer. If
he's never to be anything, of course
forcing could never make him into
something. It would certainly bring
on a family disturbance and the family
disturbance would be sure to get on
my nerves at the bank and I might
make mistakes in my figures."</p>

<p class="pmb3">Then in the April of that year, about
the time the woods were turning green
and he began to look toward them with
the old longing now grown stronger,
a great thing happened to Webster.</p>

</span>ne clear morning of that
budding month of April, a
professor from one of the
two institutions of learning
in the city stood before the pupils of
the high school.</p>

<p>He was there to fulfill his part of an
experimental plan which, through the
courtesy of all concerned, had been
started upon its course at the opening
of the session the previous autumn: that
members of the two faculties should
be asked to be good enough to come&mdash;some
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
one of them once each month&mdash;and
address the school on some pleasant
field or by-field of university work,
where learning at last meets life. That
is, each professor was requested to appear
before the ravenous pupils of the
high school with a basket of ripe fruit
from his promised land of knowledge
and to distribute these as samples from
an orchard which each pupil, if he but
chose, could some day own for himself.
Or if he could not quite bring anything
so luscious and graspable as fruit, he
might at least stand in their full view
on the boundary of his kingdom and
mark out, across that dubious Common
which lies between high school
and college, a path that would lead a
boy straight to some one of the world's
great highways of knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Eight professors had courteously responded
to this invitation and had disclosed
eight splendid roadways of
the world's study. The Latin professor
had opened up his colossal Roman-built
highway with its pictures of the
ages when all the world's thoroughfares
led to Rome. The professor of Greek
had disclosed the longer path which
leads back to Hellas with its frieze of
youth in eternal snow. The professor
of Astronomy had taken his band of
listeners forth into the immensities of
roadless space and had all but lost
them and the poor little earth itself in
the coming and going of myriads of
entangled stars. Eight professors had
come, eight professors had gone, it was
now April, a professor of Geology, as
next to the last lecturer, stood before
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Interest in the lectures had steadily
mounted from the first and was now at
highest pitch. He faced an audience
eager, intelligent, respectful and grateful.
On their part they consented that
the man before them embodied what
he had come to teach&mdash;the blending of
life and learning. Plainly the study
of the earth's rocks had not hardened
him, acquaintance with fossils had not
left him a human fossil. And he hid
the number of his years within the sap
of living sympathies as a tree hides
the notation of its years within the
bark.</p>

<p>Letting his eyes wander over them
silently for a moment, he began without
waste of a word&mdash;a straightforward
and powerful personality.</p>

<p>"I am going to speak to you boys
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
about a boy who never reached high
school. I want you to watch how that
boy's life, first seen in the distance
through mist and snow and storm as a
faint glimmering spark, rudely blown
upon by the winds of misfortune, endangered
and all but ready to go out&mdash;I
want you to watch how that endangered
spark of a boy's life slowly begins
to brighten in the distance, to
grow stronger, and finally to draw nearer
and nearer until at last it shines as a
great light about you here in this very
place. Watch, I say, how a troubled
ray, low on life's horizon, at last becomes
a star in the world of men, high
fixed and resplendent&mdash;to be seen by
human eyes as long as there shall be
human eyes to see anything."</p>

<p>He saw that he had caught their attention.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Their sympathy reacted upon
him.</p>

<p>"Before I speak of the boy I wish to
speak of a book. I hope all of you have
read one of the very beautiful stories
of English literature by George Eliot
called <i>Silas Marner</i>. If you have,
none of you will ever forget that Silas
Marner belonged to a class of pallid,
undersized men who, a hundred or a
hundred and fifty years ago, under
pressure upon the centres of population
in England and through competition
of trade, were driven out of the
towns into the country. There, as
strangers, as alien-looking remnants of
a discredited race, there in districts far
away among the lanes or in the deep
bosom of the hills, perhaps an hour's
ride from any turnpike or beyond the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
faint sound of the coach-horn, they
spent their lives as obscure weavers
and peddlers.</p>

<p>"You will never forget George Eliot's
vivid, powerful, touching picture of
Silas Marner at work in a little stone
cottage near a deserted stone pit, amid
the nut-bearing hedgerows of the
village of Raveloe. When the schoolboys
of the village came to the hedges
in autumn to gather nuts or in spring
to look for bird-nests&mdash;you boys still
do that, I hope&mdash;when they came and
heard the uncanny sound of the loom,
so unlike that of the familiar flail on
threshing floors, they would crowd
around the windows and peep in at the
weaver in his treadmill attitude, weaving
like a solitary spider month after
month and year after year his endless
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
web. Silas Marner, pausing in his
work to adjust some trouble in his
thread and discovering them and annoyed
by the intrusion, would descend
from the loom and come to his door
and gaze out at them with his strange,
blurred, protuberant eyes; for he was
so near-sighted that he could see distinctly
only objects close to him, such
as his thread, his shuttle, his loom.</p>

<p>"If for a few days the sound of the
loom stopped, it was because the
weaver, with his pack on his feeble
shoulders, was away on journeys
through fields and lanes to deliver
his linen to those who had ordered it
or who might haply buy.</p>

<p>"The village of Raveloe, as you remember,
lay on the rich, central plain
of Merry England, with wooded hollows
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and well-walled orchards and ornamental
weathercocks and church
spires rising peacefully above green
tree-tops. But Silas Marner saw nothing
of the Merry England through
which he peddled his cloth. He walked
through it all with the outdoor loneliness
of those who cannot see. His
mother had bequeathed him knowledge
of a few herbs; and these were the only
thing in nature that he had ever gropingly
looked for along hedgerows and
lanesides&mdash;foxglove and dandelion and
coltsfoot.</p>

<p>"Now, if you have read the story,
you have a far more living, touching
picture of the life of a weaver in those
distant times that I could possibly
paint. The genius of George Eliot
painted it supremely and I point to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
her masterpiece rather than to any
faint semblance I could draw. What
I want you to do is to get deeply into
your minds what the life of a weaver
in those days meant: a little further
on you will understand why.</p>

<p>"Next I want you to think of Silas
Marner as an all too common figure
of the present time. He is a type of
those of us who go through our lives
all but blind to the surpassingly beautiful
life of the planet on which it is
our strange and glorious destiny to
spend our human days. He is a type
of those of us who, in town or city, see
only the implements of our trade or
business ever close to our eyes&mdash;our
shuttle, our thread, our loom, of whatever
kind these may be. When we go
out into the world of nature, he is also
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
a type of those of us, who recognise
only the few things we need&mdash;our coltsfoot,
our foxglove, our dandelion, of
whatever kind these may be. In the
midst of woods and fields we gaze
blankly around us with vision blurred
by ignorance&mdash;not born blind but remaining
as blind because we do not
care or have not learned to open and
to train our eyes. We have the outdoor
loneliness of Silas Marner."</p>

<p>He waited a few moments to allow
his words to make their impression,
and long accustomed to the countenance
of listeners, he felt sure that
they were following him in the road
he pursued: then he led them forward:</p>

<p>"Now, about the period that George
Eliot paints the life of her poor English
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
weaver there lived, not in Merry England
but in Bonnie Scotland&mdash;and to be
bonnie is not to be merry&mdash;there lived
in the little town of Paisley, in the west
of Scotland, a man by the name of
Alexander Wilson, a poor illiterate
distiller. He had a son&mdash;the boy I am
to tell you about.</p>

<p>"The poor illiterate distiller and
father desired to give his son his name
but not to assign him his place in life,
not his own road; he named him Alexander
and he wished him to be not a
distiller but a physician. The boy's
mother was a native of an island of the
Hebrides&mdash;your geographies will have
to tell you where the Hebrides are, for
doubtless you have all forgotten! The
inhabitants of those wild, bleak, storm-swept
islands thought much of danger
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and death and therefore often of God.
Perhaps the natives of small islands
are, as a rule, either very superstitious
or very religious. His mother desired
him to be a minister. You may not
know that the Scotch people are, perhaps,
peculiarly addicted to being either
doctors of the body or doctors of the
soul. The entire Scottish race would
appear to be desirous of being physicians
to something or to somebody&mdash;not
submitting easily, however, to be
doctored!</p>

<p>"Thus the boy's father and mother
opened before him the two main honoured
roads of Scottish life and bade
him choose. He chose neither, for he
was self-willed and wavering, and did
not know his own mind or his own wish.
He did know that he would not take
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the roads his parents pointed out; as to
them he was a roadless boy.</p>

<p>"His mother died when he was quite
young, a stepmother stepped into a
stepmother's place, and she quickly
decided with Scotch thrift. A third
Scottish road should be opened to the
boy and into that he should be pushed
and made to go: he must be put to
trade. Accordingly, when he was about
eleven years old, he was taken from
school and bound as an apprentice to
a weaver: we lament child labour now:
it is an old lament.</p>

<p>"The boy hated weaving as, perhaps,
he never hated anything else in
his life and in time he hated much and
he hated many things. He seems soon
to have become known as the lazy
weaver. Years afterward he put into
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
bitter words a description of the weaver:
'A weaver is a poor, emaciated,
helpless being, shivering over rotten
yarn and groaning over his empty flour
barrel.' Elsewhere he called the weaver
a scarecrow in rags. He wrote a poem
entitled <i>Groans from the Loom</i>.</p>

<p>"Five interminable years of those
groans and all his eager, wild, headstrong,
liberty-loving boyhood was
ended: gone from him as he sat like a
boy-spider with a thread passing endlessly
into a web. During these interminable
years, whenever he lifted his
eyes from his loom and looked ahead,
he could see nothing but penury and
dependence and loneliness&mdash;his loom
to the end of his life.</p>

<p>"Five years of this imprisonment
and then he was eighteen and his own
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
master; and the first thing he did was
to descend from the loom, take a pack
of cloth upon his shoulders and go
wandering away from the hills and valleys
and lakes of Scotland&mdash;free at last
like a young deer in the heather. He
said of himself that from that hour
when his eyes had first opened on the
light of grey Scotch mountains, the
world of nature had called him. He
did not yet know what the forest and
the life of the forest meant or would
ever mean; he only knew that there he
was happy and at home.</p>

<p>"Thus, like Silas Marner, he became
a poor weaver and peddler but not with
Silas Marner's eyes. Seldom in any
human head has the mechanism of
vision been driven by a mind with such
power and eagerness to observe. And
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
he had the special memory of the eye.
There are those of us who have the
special memory of the ear or of taste or
of touch. He had the long, faithful
recollection of things seen. With this
pair of eyes during the next several
years he traversed on foot three-fourths
of Scotland. Remember, you boys
of the rolling bluegrass plateau, what
the scenery of Scotland is! Think what
it meant to traverse three-fourths of
that country, you who consider it a
hardship to walk five level miles, a
misfortune to be obliged to walk ten,
the adventure of a lifetime to walk
twenty.</p>

<p>"But though he followed one after
another well nigh all the roads of
Scotland, he could find in all Scotland
no road of life for him. It is true that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
certain misleading paths beckoned to
him, as is apt to be true in every life.
Thus he had conceived a great desire
to weave poetry instead of cloth, to
weave music instead of listening to the
noise of the loom: he had his flute and
his violin. But what he accomplished
with poetry and flute and violin were
obstacles to his necessary work and
rendered this harder. The time he
gave to them made his work less: the
less his work, the less his living; the
less his living, the more his troubles
and hardships.</p>

<p>"Once he started out both to peddle
his wares and to solicit orders for a
little book of his poems he wished to
publish. To help both pack and poetry
he wrote a handbill in verse. Some of
the lines ran thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Here's handkerchiefs charming, book muslins like ermine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Brocaded, striped, corded, or checked.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet Venus, they say, on Cupid's birthday<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In British-made muslin was decked.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Now, ye Fair, if you choose any piece to peruse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With pleasure I'll instantly show it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the peddler should fail to be favoured with sale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then I hope you'll encourage the poet.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The result seems to have been but
small sale for British-made muslins and
no sale at all for Wilson-made poems.</p>

<p>"Robert Burns was just then the
idolised poet of Scotland, a new sun
shining with vital splendour into all
Scottish hearts. Friends of the young
weaver and apparently the young weaver
himself thought there was room in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Scotland for another Burns. Some of
his poems were published anonymously
and the authorship was attributed to
Burns. That was bad for him, it made
bad worse. Wilson greatly desired to
know the rustic poet-king of Scotland.
The two poets met in Edinburgh and
were to become friends. Then Burns
published <i>Tam O'Shanter</i>. As young
Kentuckians, of course, you love horses
and cannot be indifferent even to
poems on the tails of horses. Therefore,
you must already know the world's
most famous poem concerning a horse-tail&mdash;<i>Tam
O'Shanter</i>. The Paisley
weaver by this time had such conceit of
himself as a poet that he wrote Burns
a caustic letter, telling him the kind of
poem <i>Tam O'Shanter</i> should and should
not be. Burns replied, closing the correspondence,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
ending the brief friendship
and leaving the weaver to go back
to his loom. It was a terrible rebuff,
and left its mark on an already discouraged
man.</p>

<p>"Next Wilson wrote an anonymous
poem, so violently attacking a wealthy
manufacturer on behalf of his poor
brother weavers, that the enraged merchant
demanded the name of the
writer and had him put in prison and
compelled him to stand in the public
cross of Paisley and burn his poem.</p>

<p>"Darker, bitterer days followed. He
shrank away to a little village even
more obscure than his birthplace.
There, lifting his eyes, again he looked
all over Scotland: he saw the wrongs
and sufferings of the poor, the luxury
and oppression of the rich: he blamed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the British government for evils inherent
in human nature and for the
imperfections of all human society:
turned against his native country and
at heart found himself without a fatherland.</p>

<p>"Then that glorious vision which has
opened before so many men in their
despair, disclosed itself: his eyes turned
to America. You should never forget
that from the first your country has
been the refuge and the hope for the
oppressed, the unfortunate, the discouraged
of the whole world. In
America he thought all roads were open,
new roads were being made for human
lives; that should become his country.
One autumn he saw in a newspaper an
advertisement that an American merchantman
would sail from Belfast the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
following spring and he turned to weaving
and wove as never before to earn
his passage money. At this time he
lived on one shilling a week! And it
seems that just now he undertook to
make up his lack of knowledge of arithmetic.
Some of you boys will doubtless
greatly rejoice to hear that he was deficient
in arithmetic! When spring came,
with the earnings of his loom he walked
across Scotland to the nearest port.
When he reached Belfast every berth
on the vessel had been taken: he asked
to be allowed to sleep on the deck and
was accepted as a passenger.</p>

<p>"He had now left Scotland to escape
the loom&mdash;never to see Scotland again.</p>

<p>"And you see, he is beginning to
come nearer.</p>

<p>"The vessel was called The Swift and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
it took The Swift two months to make
the passage. The port was to be Philadelphia
but he seems to have been so
impatient to set foot on the soil of the
New World that he left the ship at
New Castle, Delaware. He had borrowed
from a fellow-passenger sufficient
money to pay his expenses while walking
to Philadelphia thirty-four miles
away; and with this in his pocket and
his fowling-piece on his shoulder he
disappeared in the July forests of New
Jersey. The first thing he did was to
kill a red-headed wood-pecker which he
declared to be the most beautiful bird
he had ever seen.</p>

<p>"I do not find any word of his that
he had ever killed a bird in Scotland
during all his years of wandering. Now
the first event that befell him in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
New World was to go straight to the
American woods and kill what he declared
to be the most beautiful bird
he had ever seen. This might naturally
have been to him a sign of his life-road.
But he still stood blinded in
his path, with not a plan, not an idea,
of what he should be or could be: he
had not yet read the handwriting on
the wall within himself.</p>

<p>"His first years in the New World
were more disastrous than any in Scotland,
for always now he had the loneliness
and dejection of a man who has
rejected his own country and does not
know that any other country will accept
him. A fellow Scot, in Philadelphia,
tried him at copper-plate printing.
He quickly dropped this and
went back to the old dreadful work of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
weaving&mdash;he became an American
weaver and went wandering through
the forests of New Jersey as a peddler:
at least peddling left him free to roam
the forests. Next he tried teaching
but he himself had been taken from
school at the age of eleven and must
prepare himself as one of his own beginners.
He did not like this teaching
experiment in New Jersey and migrated
to Virginia. Virginia did not
please him and he remigrated to Pennsylvania.
There he tried one school
after another in various places and
finally settled on the outskirts of Philadelphia:
here was his last school, for
here was the turning point of his life.</p>

<p>"I wish I had time to describe for
you the school-house with its surroundings,
for the place is to us now a picture
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
in the early American life of a
great man&mdash;all such historic pictures
are invaluable. Catch one glimpse of
it: a neat stone school-house on a
sloping green; with grey old white
oaks growing around and rows of stripling
poplars and scattered cedar trees.
A road ran near and not far away was a
little yellow-faced cottage where he
lived. The yard was walled off from
the road and there were seats within
and rosebushes and plum trees and
hop-vines. On one side hung a signboard
waving before a little roadside
inn; on the other a blacksmith shop
with its hammering. Not far off stood
the edge of the great forest 'resounding
with the songs of warblers.' In the
depths of it was a favourite spot&mdash;a
secret retreat for him in Nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"There then you see him: no longer
a youth but still young; every road he
had tried closed to him in America as
in Scotland: not a doctor, not a minister,
not a good poet, not a good flutist,
not a good violinist, not a copper-plate
engraver, not a willing weaver,
not a willing peddler, not a willing
school-teacher&mdash;none of these. No idea
yet in him that he could ever be anything.
A homeless self-exile, playing at
lonely twilights on flute and violin the
loved airs of rejected Scotland.</p>

<p>"Now it happened that near his
school was a botanical garden owned
by an American naturalist. The
American, seeing the stranger cast
down by his aimless life, offered him
his portfolio of drawings and suggested
that he try to draw a landscape,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
draw the human figure. The Scotch
weaver, the American school-teacher,
tried and disastrously failed. As a
final chance the American suggested
that he try to draw a bird. He did
try: he drew a bird. He drew again.
He drew again and again. He kept
on drawing. Nothing could keep him
from drawing. And there at last the
miracle of power and genius, so long
restless in him and driving him aimlessly
from one wrong thing to another
wrong thing, disclosed itself as dwelling
within his eyes and hands. His
drawings were so true to life, that
there could be no doubt: the road lay
straight before him and ran clear
through coming time toward eternal
fame.</p>

<p>"All the experience which he had
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
been unconsciously storing as a peddler
in Scotland now came back to
him as guiding knowledge. The marvelous
memory of his eye furnished
its discipline: from early boyhood
through sheer love he had unconsciously
been studying birds in nature,
and thus during all these wretched
years had been laying up as a youth
the foundation of his life-work as a man.</p>

<p>"Genius builds with lavish magnificence
and inconceivable swiftness;
and hardly had he succeeded with his
first drawings before he had wrought
out a monumental plan: to turn himself
free as soon as possible into the
vast, untravelled forest of the North
American continent and draw and paint
its birds. Other men, he said, would
have to found the cities of the New
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
World and open up its country. His
study was to be the lineaments of the
owl and the plumage of the lark: he had
cast in his lot with Nature's green
magnificence untouched by man."</p>

<p>The lecturer paused, as a traveller
instinctively stops to look around him
at a pleasant turn of his road. It had,
in truth, been a hard, crooked human
road along which he had been leading
his young listeners&mdash;a career choked
at every step by inward and outward
pressures. He had not failed to notice
the change in every countenance, the
brightening of every eye, as soon as
his audience discovered that they were
listening to a story, not of mere weaknesses
and failures, but of the misfortunes
and mistakes of a man, who at
last stood out as truly great. This
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
hapless weaver, this aimless wanderer
through the forests of two worlds, after
all had success in him, strength in him,
genius in him, fame in him! He was a
hero. Henceforth they were alive with
curiosity for the rest of the story which
would bring the distant hero to Kentucky,
to their Lexington.</p>

<p>The lecturer realised all this. But
he had for some time been even more
acutely aware that something wholly
personal and extraordinary was taking
place: one of the pupils of the high
school was listening with an attention
so absorbed and noticeable as to set
him apart from all the rest. Just at
what point this intense attention had
been so aroused, had not been observed;
but when once observed, there was
no forgetting it: it filled the room, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
other listeners were merely grouped
around it as accessories and helped to
make its breathless picture.</p>

<p>The particularly interested pupil sat
rather far back in the school-room,
near a window&mdash;as though from a vain
wish to jump out and be free. The
morning light thus fell across his face:
it was possible to watch its expression,
its responsive change of light at each
turn of the story. He seemed to hold
some kind of leadership in the school:
other pupils occasionally turned their
faces to glance at him, to keep in touch
with him: he did not return their
glances&mdash;being their leader; or he had
forgotten them for the story he was
hearing.</p>

<p>The lecturer became convinced that
what had more than once happened
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
to him before as a teacher was happening
again: before him a young life
was unexpectedly being solved&mdash;to its
own wonderment and liberation, to
its amazement and joy.</p>

<p>That perpetual miracle in nature&mdash;the
contexture of the generations&mdash;the
living taking the meaning of their
lives from the dead! You stand beside
some all but forgotten mound of human
ashes; before you are arrayed a band
of youths, unconsciously holding in
their hands the unlighted torches of
the future. You utter some word
about the cold ashes and silently one
of them walks forward to the ashes,
lights his torch and goes his radiant
way.</p>

<p>Thus the Geologist felt a graver responsibility
resting on him&mdash;placed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
there by one of them, more than by
all of them: the words he was speaking
might or might not give final direction
to a whole career. He went on with
his heroic narrative more glowingly,
more guardedly:</p>

<p>"For a while he must keep on teaching
in order to live: he taught all day,
often after night, barely had time to
swallow his meals, at the end of one
term tells us he had as large a sum as
fifteen dollars. Often he coloured his
first drawings by candle light, drew
and painted birds without knowing
what they were. Drawing and painting
by candle light!&mdash;but now he had
within himself the risen sun of a splendid
enthusiasm. That sun kindled
his schoolboys. They found out what
he wanted and helped. One boy
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
brought him a large basketful of crows.
Another caught a mouse in school and
contributed that&mdash;the incident is worth
quoting by showing that the boy preferred
a mouse to a school-book.</p>

<p>"Take one instance of the energy
with which he was now working and
worked for the rest of his life: he
wished to see Niagara Falls, and to
lose no time while doing it he started
out one autumn through the forest to
walk to the Falls and back, a short
trip for him of over twelve hundred
miles. He reached home 'mid the deep
snows of winter with no soles to his
boots. What of that? On his way
back he had shot two strange birds in
the valley of the Hudson! For ten
days&mdash;ten days, mind you!&mdash;he worked
on a drawing of these and sent it with
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
a letter to Thomas Jefferson. You
may as yet have thought of Jefferson
only as one of America's earliest statesmen:
begin now to think of him as
one of the first American naturalists.
And if you wish to read a courteous
letter from an American President to
a young stranger, go back to Jefferson's
letter to the Scotch weaver who
sent him the drawing of a jaybird.</p>

<p>"Pass rapidly over the next few
years. He has made one trip from
Maine down the Atlantic Seaboard to
the South. He has returned and is
starting out again to cover the vast
interior basin of the Mississippi Valley:
he is to begin at Pittsburgh and
end at New Orleans.</p>

<p>"Now again you see that he is coming
nearer&mdash;nearer to you here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look then at this bold, splendid
picture of him outlined against the
background of early American life.
All such pictures are part of our richest
heritage.</p>

<p>"The scene is Pittsburgh. He has
ransacked the winter woods for new
species, he has found only sparrows
and snow-birds. That was the year
1810; this is the year 1916&mdash;over a
hundred years later in the history of
our country. Gaze then upon this wild
scene of the olden time, all such pictures
are good for young eyes: it is
the twenty-fourth of February: the
river, swollen with the spring flood,
is full of white masses of moving ice.
A frail skiff puts off from shore and
goes winding its way until it is lost to
sight among the noble hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"They warned him of his danger,
urged him to take a rower, urged him
not to go at all. Those who risked the
passage of the river floated down on
barges called Kentucky arks or in
canoes hollowed each out of a single
tree, usually the tulip tree, which you
know is very common in our Kentucky
woods. But to mention danger was
to make him go to meet it. He would
have no rower, had no money to hire
one, had he wished one. He tells us
what he had on board: in one end of
the boat some biscuit and cheese, a
bottle of cordial given him by a gentleman
in Pittsburgh, his gun and trunk
and overcoat; at the other end himself
and his oars and a tin with which
to bail out the skiff, if necessary, to
keep it from sinking and also to use
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
as his drinking-cup to dip from the
river.</p>

<p>"That February day&mdash;the swollen,
rushing river, the masses of white ice&mdash;the
solitary young boatman borne
away to a new world on his great work:
his heart expanding with excitement
and joy as he headed toward the unexplored
wilderness of the Mississippi
Valley.</p>

<p>"Wondrous experiences were his:
from the densely wooded shores there
would reach him as he drifted down,
the whistle of the red bird&mdash;those first
spring notes so familiar and so welcome
to us on mild days toward the
last of February. Away off in dim
forest valleys, between bold headlands,
he saw the rising smoke of sugar camps.
At other openings on the landscape,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
grotesque log cabins looked like dog-houses
under impending mighty mountains.
His rapidly steered skiff passed
flotillas of Kentucky arks heavily making
their way southward, transporting
men and women and children&mdash;the
moving pioneers of the young nation:
the first river merchant-marine of the
new world: carrying horses and plows
to clearings yet to be made for homesteads
in the wilderness; transporting
mill-stones for mills not yet built on
any wilderness stream; bearing merchandise
for the pioneers who in this
way got their clothing until they could
grow flax and weave to clothe themselves.
Thus in the Alps of the Alleghenies
he came upon the river peddlers
of America as years before amid
the Alps of Scotland he had come
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
upon the foot peddlers of his own land.
On the river were floating caravans of
men selling shawls and muslins. He
boarded a number of these barges; as
they approached a settlement, they
blew a trumpet or a lonely horn on
the great river stillness.</p>

<p>"The first night he drew in to shore
some fifty miles down at a riverside
hovel and tried to sleep on the only
bed offered him&mdash;some corn-stalks. Unable
to sleep, he got up before day and
pushed out again into the river, listening
to the hooting of the big-horned
owl echoing away among the dawn-dark
mountains, or to the strangely
familiar crowing of cocks as they
awoke the hen roosts about the first
American settlements in the West.</p>

<p>"He records what to us now sounds
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
incredible, that on March fifth he saw
a flock of parrokeets. Think of parrokeets
on the Ohio River in March!
Of nights it turned freezing cold and
he drew liberally on his bottle of cordial
for warmth. Once he encountered
a storm of wind and hail and snow
and rain, during which the river foamed
and rolled like the sea and he had to
make good use of his tin to keep the
skiff bailed out till he could put in to
shore. The call of wild turkeys enticed
him now toward the shore of
Indiana, now toward the shore of
Kentucky, but before he reached either
they had disappeared. His first night
on the Kentucky shore he spent in the
cabin of a squatter and heard him tell
tales of bear-treeing and wildcat-hunting
and wolf-baiting. All night wolves
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
howled in the forests near by and kept
the dogs in an uproar; the region
swarmed with wolves and wildcats
'black and brown.'</p>

<p>"On and on, until at last the skiff
reached the rapids of the Ohio at Louisville
and he stepped ashore and sold
his frail saviour craft which, at starting,
he had named the Ornithologist. The
Kentuckian who bought it as the Ornithologist
accepted the droll name as
that of some Indian chief. He soon
left Louisville, having sent his baggage
on by wagon, and plunged into the
Kentucky forest on his way to Lexington.</p>

<p>"And now, indeed, you see he is
coming nearer.</p>

<p>"It was the twenty-fourth of March
when he began his first trip southward
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
through the woods of Kentucky. Spring
was on the way but had not yet passed
northward. Nine-tenths of the Kentucky
soil, he states, was then unbroken
wilderness. The surface soil was deeper
than now. The spring thaw had set in,
permeating the rich loam. He describes
his progress through it as like travelling
through soft soap. The woods were
bare as yet, though filled with pigeons
and squirrels and wood-peckers. On
everything he was using his marvellous
eyes: looking for birds but looking at
all human life, interested in the whole
life of the forest. He mentions large
corn fields and orchards of apple and of
peach trees. Already he finds the high
fences, characteristic of the Kentuckians.
He turned aside once to visit a
roosting place of the passenger pigeon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was on March twenty-ninth that,
emerging from the thick forest, he saw
before him the little Western metropolis
of the pioneers, the city of the forefathers
of many of us here today&mdash;Lexington.
I wish I could stop to describe
to you the picture as he painted
it: the town stretching along its low
valley; a stream running through the
valley and turning several mills&mdash;water
mills in Lexington a hundred years ago!
In the market-place which you now call
Cheapside he saw the pillory and the
stocks and he noted that the stocks
were so arranged as to be serviceable for
gallows: our Kentucky forefathers arranged
that they should be conveniently
hanged, if they deserved it, as a public
spectacle of warning.</p>

<p>"On a country court day he saw a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
thousand horses hitched around the
courthouse square and in churchyards
and in graveyards. He states that
even then Kentucky horses were the
most remarkable in the world.</p>

<p>"He makes no mention of one thing
he must have seen, but was perhaps
glad to forget&mdash;the weavers and the
busy looms; for in those days Kentuckians
were busy making good linen
and good homespun, as in Paisley.</p>

<p>"He slept while in Lexington&mdash;this
great unknown man&mdash;in a garret called
Salter White's, wherever that was: and
he shivered with cold, for you know we
can have chill nights in April. He says
that he had no firewood, it being scarce,
the universal forest of firewood being
half a mile away: this was like going
hungry in a loft over a full baker-shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I must not omit one note of his
on the Kentuckians themselves, which
flashes a vivid historic light on their
character. By this time he rightly
considered that he had had adventures
worth relating; but he declares that if
he attempted to relate them to any
Kentuckian, the Kentuckian at once
interrupted him and insisted upon relating
his own adventures as better
worth while. Western civilization was
of itself the one absorbing adventure to
every man who had had his share in it.</p>

<p>"Here I must pause to intimate that
Wilson all his life carried with him one
bird&mdash;one vigourous and vociferous bird&mdash;a
crow to pick. He picked it savagely
with Louisville. But he had begun to
pick it with Scotland. He had picked
it with Great Britain and with New
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Jersey and Virginia. In New England
the feathers of the crow fairly flew. In
truth, civilization never quite satisfied
him; wild nature alone he found no
fault with&mdash;there only was he happy
and at home. He now picked his crow
with Lexington. Afterward an indignant
Kentuckian, quite in the good
Kentucky way, attacked him and left
the crow featherless&mdash;as regards Lexington.</p>

<p>"On the fourteenth day of April
he departed from Lexington, moving
southward through the forest to New
Orleans. Scarcely yet had the woods
begun to turn green. He notes merely
the white blossoms of the redroot peeping
through the withered leaves, and
the buds of the buckeye. With those
sharp eyes of his he observed that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
wherever a hackberry tree had fallen,
cattle had eaten the bark.</p>

<p>"And now we begin to take leave of
him: he passes from our picture. We
catch a glimpse of him standing on the
perpendicular cliffs of solid limestone
at the Kentucky River, green with a
great number of uncommon plants and
flowers&mdash;we catch a glimpse of him
standing there, watching bank swallows
and listening to the faint music of the
boat horns in the deep romantic valley
below, where the Kentucky arks, passing
on their way southward, turned the
corners of the verduous cliffs as the
musical gondolas turn the corners of
vine-hung Venice in the waters of the
Adriatic.</p>

<p>"On and on southward; visiting a
roosting-place of the passenger pigeon
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
which was reported to him as forty
miles long: he counted ninety nests in
one beech tree. We see him emerging
upon the Kentucky barrens which were
covered with vegetation and open for
the sweep of the eye.</p>

<p>"Now, at last, he begins to meet the
approach of spring in full tide: all Nature
is bursting into leaf and blossom.
No longer are the redbud and the dogwood
and the sassafras conspicuous as
its heralds. And now, overflowing the
forest, advances the full-crested wave
of bird-life up from the south, from the
tropics. New and unknown species are
everywhere before his eyes; their new
melodies are in his ears; he is busy
drawing, colouring, naming them for
his work.</p>

<p>"So he passes out of our picture:
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
southward bound, encountering a cloud
of parrakeets and pigeons, emerging
from a cave with a handkerchief full of
bats, swimming creeks, sleeping at
night alone in the wilderness, his gun
and pistol in his bosom. He vanishes
from the forest scene, never from the
memory of mankind.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you that he did not live
to complete his work. Death overtook
him, not a youth but still young; for, as
a Roman of the heroic years deeply
said: 'Death always finds those young
who are still at work for the future of
the world.'</p>

<p>"I told you I was going to speak to
you of a boy's life. I asked you to fix
your eyes upon it as a far-off human
spark, barely glimmering through mist
and fog but slowly, as the years passed,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
getting stronger, growing brighter, always
drawing nearer until it shone
about you here as a great light and then
passed on, leaving an eternal glory.</p>

<p>"I have done that.</p>

<p>"You saw a little fellow taken from
school at about the age of eleven and
put to hard work at weaving; now you
see one of the world's great ornithologists,
who had traversed some ten thousand
miles of comparative wilderness&mdash;an
imperishable figure, doing an imperishable
deed. I love to think of him as
being in the end what he most hated
to be in the beginning&mdash;a weaver: he
wove a vast, original tapestry of the
bird-life of the American forest.</p>

<p>"As he passed southward from Lexington
that distant April of 1810, encountering
his first spring in the Ohio
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
valley with its myriads of birds, somewhere
he discovered a new and beautiful
species of American wood warbler
and gave it a local habitation and a
name.</p>

<p>"He called it the Kentucky Warbler.</p>

<p>"And now," the lecturer said, by way
of climax, "would you not like to see a
picture of that mighty hunter who lived
in the great days of the young American
republic and crossed Kentucky in
the great days of the pioneers? And
would you not also like to see a picture
of the exquisite and only bird that bears
the name of our State&mdash;the Kentucky
Warbler?"</p>

<p class="pmb3">He passed over to them a portrait engraving
of Alexander Wilson in the
dress of a gentleman of his time, his
fowling-piece on his forearm. And
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
along with this he delivered to them a
life-like, a singing portrait, of the warbler,
painted by a great American animal
painter and bird painter&mdash;Fuertes.</p>

</span>t was the first day of vacation.</p>

<p>Schools, if you were not
through with them, had
now become empty, closed, silent
buildings, stripped of authority to
imprison and bedevil you and then
mark you discreditably because you
righteously rebelled against being imprisoned
and bedeviled. They could
safely be left to dust and cobwebs
within and to any weeds that might
lodge and sprout outside&mdash;the more the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
better. You stood on the spring edge
of the long, free, careless summer and
could look unconcernedly across at the
distant autumn edge. Then as the
woods, now in their first full green, were
beginning to turn dry and yellow, the
powerless buildings would again become
tyrannical schools.</p>

<p>But if you had finished high school,
on this first day of vacation you were
on the Boy's Common: schools behind
you, the world of business around you,
ahead of you ambitious college or the
stately University. Webster had been
turned loose on the Boy's Common.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The family were at breakfast. Every
breakfast in the cottage was much the
same breakfast: routine is the peace of
the roadless. Existence there throughout
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the year was three hundred and
sixty-five times more or less like itself.
The earth meantime did change for the
signs of the zodiac: the cottage changed
also, but had a zodiac of its own.
Thus, when the planet was in the sign
of <i>Capricornus</i>, the cottage on a morning
had fried perch for breakfast, as a
sign that it was in <i>Pisces</i>; when earth
was in <i>Gemini</i>, the family might have
a steak which showed that it was in
<i>Taurus</i>&mdash;or that <i>Taurus</i> was in the
family.</p>

<p>There was always hot meat of one
kind and hot bread of two kinds and
hot coffee of any kind. If Webster's
father upon entering the breakfast
room had not seen a dish before him
to carve or apportion, the shock could
not have been greater, had he found
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
lying on his folded napkin an enclosure
from the bank notifying him that he
had been discharged for having made
the figure four instead of the figure two.</p>

<p>He sat squarely facing the table as
long as his own portion of the meat
lasted, meantime eating rapidly and
bending over to glance at his paper
which lay flat beside his coffee cup.
With the final morsel of meat he turned
sidewise and sat cross-legged, with his
paper held before his face as a screen&mdash;notification
that he would rather not
talk at the moment, unless they preferred....
If they showed that
they did prefer, he still had means to
discourage their preference. Now and
then he reached around toward his
plate and groped for the remaining
crumbs of bread, or hooked his forefinger
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
in the handle of his cup and conveyed
it behind the paper.</p>

<p>Webster's mother, busied with service
at the tray, commenced her breakfast
after the others. She talked to
her husband until he interposed his
newspaper. Then she unconsciously
lowered her voice and addressed remarks
to the children. Occasionally
she tried to arrange their dissensions.</p>

<p>A satirist of human life, studying
Webster's father and mother at the
head and foot of the table&mdash;symbol at
once of their opposition and conjunction&mdash;a
satirist, who for his own amusement
turns life into pictures of something
else, might have described their
bodily and pictorial relation as that
of a large, soft deep-dished pudding
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
to a well trimmed mutton chop. Their
minds he would possibly have imagined
as two south winds moving
along, side by side; whatever else they
blew against, they could not possibly
blow against each other.</p>

<p>On this fine June morning, the first
day of his vacation, Webster was late
for breakfast. He arranged to be late.
From his bathroom-bedroom he could
hear the family with their usual morning
talk, Elinor's shrill chatter predominating.
When her chatter ceased
he would know that she had satisfied
her whimsical appetite and had slipped
from her chair, impatient either to get
to the front porch with its creaky
rocking-chair or to dart out the gate
to other little girls in the block; restlessly
seeking some adventure elsewhere
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
if none should pass before her
eyes at home.</p>

<p>He waited till she should go; there
was something especial to speak of
with his father and he did not wish
this to be spoiled by Elinor's interference
and ridicule.</p>

<p>When she was gone he went in to
breakfast.</p>

<p>"Well, my son, how are you going
to spend your first day of vacation?"
his father inquired, helping him to his
portion and not particularly noticing
his own question.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd go over into the
woods," Webster replied.</p>

<p>An unfavourable silence followed
this announcement. That old stubborn
controversy about the woods!...</p>

<p>"Father," asked Webster, with his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
eyes on his plate, "did you ever see
the Kentucky warbler?"</p>

<p>Webster's father looked over the
top of the wood-pulp screen. His
face had a somewhat vacant expression.
He waited. Finally he
said:</p>

<p>"My son, I believe you asked me a
question: I shall have to ask you to
repeat your question; I may be losing
my hearing or I may be losing my
mind. You asked me&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Webster, in the same deliberate tone,
repeated his question:</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the Kentucky
warbler?"</p>

<p>Webster's father looked over his
spectacles at Webster's mother as with
the air of an appeal for guidance:</p>

<p>"My dear, your son asks me, if I
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
understand him, whether I have ever
seen a Kentucky wooden war horse?"</p>

<p>He was not above fun-making and
it seemed to him that the occasion
called for it.</p>

<p>Webster's mother explained:</p>

<p>"One of the professors from the
University lectured to them in April
about birds. His head has been full
of birds ever since: I shouldn't wonder
if his dreams have been full of them."
She looked at Webster not without
ineradicable tenderness and pride; she
could not quite have explained the
pride, she could have explained the
tenderness.</p>

<p>Now the truth of the matter was
that since that memorable morning
of the April talk at high school, she
had been hearing from Webster repeatedly
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
on that subject. He had told
her of the lecture immediately upon
reaching home; she had never seen
him so wrought up. And from that
time he had upon occasion plied her
with questions: as to what she knew
of birds when she lived in the country.
She had to tell him that she knew very
little; everybody identified the several
species that preyed upon fruit and
berries and young chickens; she named
these readily enough. She had never
heard of a bird called the Kentucky
warbler. And she had never heard of
Alexander Wilson.</p>

<p>All this she had duly narrated to
Webster's father&mdash;greatly to his dejection.
A bank officer with a solitary
son, now graduated from high school,
going after bird-nests&mdash;that was a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
prospect before such a father! He had
shaken his head in silence that more
than spoke.</p>

<p>"I told him," Webster's mother had
concluded, "that the only Wilsons
worth knowing in Kentucky were the
horse-people Wilsons: of course we
know <i>them</i>. It has been amusing to
watch Elinor. Whenever Webster has
begun about birds, if she has overheard
him, she has made it convenient
to settle somewhere near and listen.
She would break in and stop his questions,
but then there would be no more
entertainment for her. She has been
a study."</p>

<p>Thus Webster's father was not so
ill-informed as he now appeared. In
return for the information from Webster's
mother, apparently for the first
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
time imparted, he looked at his son
with an expression which plainly meant
that as a speculation the latter was
becoming a graver risk.</p>

<p>"No, my son," he said, "I have
never met your forest friend. I am
merely a Kentucky bank warbler. One
who did his warbling years ago. There
is some <i>war</i> left in me. I suppose there
will always be <i>war</i> left in me, but there
isn't any <i>war</i>-ble. I warbled one distant
solitary spring to your mother.
She replied beautifully in kind and
lavishly in degree. We made a nest
and had a hatching. Since then the
male bird has been trying&mdash;not to
escape the consequences of his song&mdash;but
to meet his notes like a man. I
have never stumbled upon your forest
friend."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Webster ate in silence for a few
moments and then remarked, as though
it were a matter of vital importance:</p>

<p>"His notes are:</p>

<p>"'<i>Tweedle tweedle tweedle, Tweedle
tweedle tweedle</i>,' Wilson described them
that way a hundred and six years ago."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it, my son. I am not
questioning your word&mdash;nor Mr. Wilson's.
But I don't see anything very
remarkable in that: if you come to the
bank any day, you can hear men say
the same thing. They come in and
say, 'Tweedle.' And they go out."</p>

<p>Webster continued:</p>

<p>"Audubon described the notes as
'<i>Turdle turdle turdle</i>.'"</p>

<p>Deeper silence at the table. Webster
continued in the face of the
silence;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"A living naturalist says the notes
may be:</p>

<p>"'<i>Toodle toodle toodle.</i>'"</p>

<p>Silence at the table still more deep.
Webster broke it:</p>

<p>"Another naturalist describes the
bird as saying:</p>

<p>"'<i>Ter-wheeter wheeter wheeter wheeter
wheeter.</i>'"</p>

<p>The silence! Webster continued:</p>

<p>"Another naturalist thinks the song
is:</p>

<p>"'<i>Che che che peery peery peery.</i>'"</p>

<p>Webster's father raised his eyebrows&mdash;he
had no hair to raise&mdash;at Webster's
mother: a sign that their graduate
was beginning to celebrate his vacation.</p>

<p>"My son," he said, "when I was a
little fellow in school, one of the reading
lessons was a poem called 'Try,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Try Again.' Perhaps the bird is working
along that line."</p>

<p>"Thomas Jefferson followed a bird
for hours in the woods," said Webster,
with dignity: he somehow felt rebuked.
"And for twenty years he
tried to catch sight of another."</p>

<p>"Don't let me come between you and
Thomas Jefferson," said Webster's
father, waving his hand toward his
son in protest. "God forbid that I
should come between any two such
persons as Daniel Webster and Thomas
Jefferson!"</p>

<p>"The government at Washington,"
observed Webster stoutly, "is behind
the Kentucky warbler."</p>

<p>"Then, my son, I advise you to get
behind the Government."</p>

<p>The rusty bell at the little front door
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
went off with a sound like the whirr of
a frightened prairie chicken. The
breakfast maid, also the cook, also the
maid of all work, also a unit of the
standardised population of disservice
and discontent, entered and pushed a
bill at Webster's father.</p>

<p>"The butcher," she announced with
sullen gratification, "He's waiting."</p>

<p>As Webster's father left the table,
he tapped his son affectionately on the
head with his paper: "You follow the
bird, my boy; and follow Thomas
Jefferson, if you can. The butcher
follows me."</p>

<p>Webster's mother sat watching him.
He had begun to get his lunch ready.
He held the bottom-half of a long,
slender roll, which might have served
as a miniature model for an old-time
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Kentucky river-ark; and with his knife,
grasped like an oar, he was lining the
inside with some highly specialised yellow
substance. She deplored his awkwardness
and fought his independence.</p>

<p>"Let me put up your lunch for you,
my son!"</p>

<p>"I'll put it up."</p>

<p>He was not to be cheated out of that
fresh sensation of pleasure which comes
to the male, young or old, who tries to
cook in camp, to fry, to boil, to season,
or to serve things edible.</p>

<p>Webster pulled out of his pocket a
crumpled piece of brown paper and
smoothed it out on the table cloth. It
showed butcher stains.</p>

<p>Webster's mother protested.</p>

<p>"My son! Take a napkin! Take
this clean napkin for your lunch!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I like this paper."</p>

<p>The idea of being in the forest and
unrolling his lunch from a napkin:
what would Wilson have thought?
Elinor, being "nice," always rolled her
lunch in a napkin.</p>

<p>"But you will be hungry: let me get
you some preserves!"</p>

<p>"Not anything sweet." Elinor always
had preserves. He rolled his
lunch roughly and thrust it, butcher-stains
and all, into his pocket. His
mother was exasperated and distressed.</p>

<p>"My son, your lunch will come loose
in your pocket: I'll get you a string."</p>

<p>"I don't want a string." Elinor tied
everything. Girls tied; boys buttoned.
The difference between men and women
was strings.</p>

<p>"But you'll get the grease on you,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Webster! It will run down your
legs!"</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I'll have greasy
legs. Why not?"</p>

<p>She followed him out to the porch.
Her character lacked capacity of initiative.
She waited for him to be old
enough to take some initiative; then she
would stand by him.</p>

<p>"Don't go too far," she said tenderly,
"and you ought to have some of your
friends to go with you, some of the boys
from school."</p>

<p>"They can't go today. Nobody can
go today. Anybody would be in the
way today."</p>

<p>He said this to himself.</p>

<p>She watched him from the porch and
called: "Don't stay too late."</p>

<p>Webster walked quickly to the main
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
corner of the block&mdash;Jenny's corner.
On this first morning of being through
with school and of feeling more like a
man free to do as he pleased, Jenny for
that reason became more important&mdash;he
must see her before starting. Heretofore
the pleasure of being with Jenny
had definitely depended upon what
Jenny might do; this morning the idea
was beginning to be Jenny herself.</p>

<p>She was in her trumpet-vine arbour,
the roof of which was already sun-dried.
The shaded sides were still dew-wet.
She bounded across to him, very
exquisite in her light blue frock with
broad, fresh white ribbons in her light-brown
hair: healthy, docile, joyous,
with innocent blue eyes and the complexion
of apple blossoms.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she asked
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
in a voice which implied that the day
would be as pleasant, no matter where
he went: nevertheless she had no
thought of appearing indifferent to him.</p>

<p>He told her.</p>

<p>"What are you going into the woods
for?" she inquired, with little dancing
movements of her feet on the yard
grass in irrepressible health and joy and
with no especial interest in his reply.</p>

<p>He told her.</p>

<p>"Could <i>you</i> go?" He very well knew
she could not and merely yielded to an
impulse to express himself: he was
offering to ruin the day for her.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't let me," said Jenny,
apparently not disappointed at being
thus kept at home.</p>

<p>He sought to make the best of his
disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even if you could go, I am afraid
you never would be quiet, Jenny."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I wouldn't," Jenny replied,
responsive to every suggestion.</p>

<p>He lingered, tenderly disturbed by
her: the roots of the future were growing
in him this morning. He was
changing, he was changing <i>her</i>: there
was an outreaching of his nature to
draw her into the future alongside him.</p>

<p>Jenny suddenly stopped dancing and
came closer to the fence, having all at
once become more conscious of Webster,
standing there as he had never
stood before, looking at her as he had
never looked. Her nature was of yielding
sweetness, clasping trust. She
glanced around the cottage windows:
the situation was very exposed. Webster
glanced at the cottage windows:
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the situation did not appear in the
least exposed. Her eyes became more
round with an idea:</p>

<p>"Are you coming back this way?"</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> come back this way."</p>

<p>Jenny danced away from the fence,
laughing excitedly: "Will it be late?"</p>

<p>"I can <i>make</i> it late?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Webster climbed the fence of the
forest under the foliage of a big tree
of some unknown kind and descended
waist-deep into the foliage of a weed
with a leaf as big as an elephant's ear:
it had a beautiful trumpet-shaped white
and purple flower. He wished he knew
what it was: on the very edge of the
forest, at his very first step, he had
sunk waist-deep into ignorance. Then
he waded through the rank nightshade
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
and stepped out upon the grass
of the woods&mdash;the green carpet of
thick turf, Kentucky bluegrass.</p>

<p>At last he was there under those
softly waving trees which summer after
summer he had watched from the porch
and windows: long they had called to
him and now he had answered their call.</p>

<p>But the disappointment! As he had
looked at the forest across the distance,
the tree-tops had made an unbroken
billowy line of green along the blue
horizon, continuous like the waves of
the sea as he imagined the sea. Somewhere
under that forest roof he had
taken it for granted that there would
be thick undergrowth, wild spots for
shy singing nesting birds. The disappointment!
The trees stood ten or
twenty or thirty feet apart. The longest
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
boughs barely touched each other,
their lowest sometimes hung forty or
fifty feet in the air. He did not see a
tree whose branches he could reach
with his upstretched arm. The sun
shone everywhere under them every
bright day and the grass grew thick up
to their trunks.</p>

<p>Another disappointment! The wood
was small. He walked to the middle
of it and from there could see to its
edge on each of its four sides. On one
side was a field of yellow grain&mdash;what
the grain was he did not know&mdash;ignorance
again. On the side opposite this
was a field of green grain&mdash;what he
did not know. Straight ahead of him
as he looked through the trees, he
could see an open paddock on which
the sunlight fell in a blazing sheen; it
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
turned to silver the white flanks of
some calves and made soft gold of the
coats of grazing thoroughbreds. Beyond
the paddock he could see stables
and sheds and beyond these a farmhouse:
he could faintly hear the cackle
of barnyard poultry.</p>

<p>He stood in bluegrass pasture&mdash;once
Kentucky wilderness. It was like
an exquisite natural park. As he had
skirmished toward the country along
turnpikes with school-mates or other
friends during his life, often his eyes
had been drawn toward these world-famous
bluegrass pastures. Now he
was in one; and it was here that he had
come to look for the warbler which
haunts the secret forest solitudes!</p>

<p>He sat down under a big tree with a
feeling of how foolish he had been.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
This was again followed by an overwhelming
sense of his ignorance.</p>

<p>He did not know the kind of tree he
sat under nor of any other that stood
far or near. These were such as sugar
maple and red oak and white oak and
black ash and white ash and black
walnut and white walnut&mdash;rarely white
walnut&mdash;and hickory and locust and
elm and a few haws: he did recognise a
locust tree but then a locust tree grew
in Jenny's yard! All around him weeds
and wild flowers and other grasses
sprang up out of the bluegrass: he did
not know them.</p>

<p>There was one tree he curiously
looked around for, positive that he
should not be blind to it if fortunate
enough to set his eyes on one&mdash;the
coffee tree. That is, he felt sure he'd
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
recognise it if it yielded coffee ready to
drink, of which never in his life had
they given him enough. Not once
throughout his long troubled experience
as to being fed had he been allowed
as much coffee as he craved.
Once, when younger, he had heard some
one say that the only tree in all the
American forest that bore the name of
Kentucky was the Kentucky coffee tree;
and he had instantly conceived a desire
to pay a visit in secret to that corner
of the woods. To take his cup and
a few lumps of sugar and sit under the
boughs and catch the coffee as it
dripped down.... No one to hold
him back ... as much as he wanted at
last ...! The Kentucky coffee tree&mdash;his
favourite in Nature!</p>

<p>He said to himself, looking all
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
round him, that he had the outdoor
loneliness and blindness of Silas
Marner this wonderful morning.</p>

<p>Propped against the tree he sat still
a while, thinking of the long day before
him and of how he should spend it
in this thin empty pasture, abandoned
by the wild creatures. But as he deliberated,
suddenly and then more and
more he awoke to things going on
around him.</p>

<p>A few feet away and on a level with
his eyes a little fellow descended from
high over-head. A little green gymnast
trying to reach the ground by
means of his own rope which he manufactured
out of his body as he came
down. How could he do it? How had
he learned the very first time to make
the rope strong enough to bear his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
weight instead of its giving way and
letting him drop? Something seized one
of Webster's ankles with a pair of small
jaws like pincers and reminded him that
his foot was in the way: it had better
move on. A black ant suddenly rushed
angrily over his knee. A cricket leaped
in the grass. One autumn one of them
had started its song behind the wainscoting,
Elinor had pushed her toe
against the woodwork and silenced it.
A few feet away a bunch of white clover
blossomed: a honey bee was searching
it. Webster found on the back of one
of his hands, which was pressed against
the grass, a tiny crimson coach&mdash;a
mere dot of a crimson coach being
moved along he could not see how.
The colour was most gorgeous and the
material of the finest velvet. He let it
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
go on its way across his hand withersoever
it might be journeying. Directly
opposite his eyes, some forty feet
from the ground, was a round hole in a
rotten tree-trunk. Webster wondered
whether a bird ever pecked a square
hole in anything. Suddenly from behind
him a red-headed bird flew to the
dead tree-trunk and alighted near the
hole: he recognised the wood-pecker.
And he remembered that this was the
first bird Wilson had killed that first
day he entered the American forest:
he was glad that it was the first <i>he</i>
encountered! No sooner had the wood-pecker
alighted than the head of another
bird appeared at the hole and the
wood-pecker took to his heels&mdash;to his
wings. Webster wished he had known
what this other bird was: it had a black
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
band across its chest and wore a
speckled jacket and a dull reddish cap
on the back of its head. A disturbance
reached him from a nearby treetop, a
wailing voice, a gulping sound, as if
something up there were sick and full
of suffering and were trying to take its
medicine. He watched the spot and
presently a crow flew out of the thick
leaves: the crow's family seemed not in
good health. A ground squirrel jumped
to the end of a rotting log some yards
away but at sight of him shrieked and
darted in again. The whole pasture
was alive.</p>

<p>Webster had all this time become
conscious that another sound had been
reaching his ear at regular intervals
from the high branches of the trees,
first in one place and then in another.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
His eyes had followed the voice but he
could see no bird. The sound was like
this:</p>

<p><i>Se&mdash;u&mdash;re?</i></p>

<p>That was the first half of the song&mdash;a
question. A few moments later the
other half followed, perhaps from another
tree&mdash;the answer:</p>

<p><i>Se&mdash;u&mdash;u.</i></p>

<p>Here was a mystery: what was the
bird? Could it be the bluebird!&mdash;his
ignorance again, the comicality of his
ignorance! Webster had never seen or
heard a bluebird. He recalled what the
professor had told them&mdash;that Alexander
Wilson had written the first poem
on the American bluebird, perhaps still
the best poem; and he had given them
the poem to memorise if they liked,
saying that they might not think it
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
good poetry, but at least it was the
poetry of a man who thought he could
criticise Robert Burns! Webster had
memorised the verses and as he now
searched the forest boughs for this invisible
bluebird, he repeated to himself
some of Wilson's lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When all the gay scenes of summer are o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And autumn slow enters so silent and sallow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And millions of warblers that charmed us before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have fled in the train of the sun-seeking swallow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bluebird, forsaken, but true to his home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still lingers and looks for a milder tomorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till forced by the horrors of winter to roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sings his adieu in a lone note of sorrow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again that long fine strain cast far
out upon the air like a silken reel:</p>

<p><i>Se&mdash;u&mdash;re? Se&mdash;u&mdash;u.</i></p>

<p>Or could it be a woodcock?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>He got up by and bye and walked
toward the field of yellow grain on one
side of the pasture. Before he was halfway
he stopped, arrested by a wonderful
sound: from the top rail of the
fence before him, separating the pasture
from the grain, came a loud ringing
whistle. It was Bobwhite! Boys at
school sometimes whistled "bobwhite."
He knew this bird because he had seen
him hanging amid snow and ice and
holly boughs outside meat shops about
Christmas time. Here now was the
summer song: in it the green of the
woods, the gold of the grain, the far
brave clearness of the June sky.</p>

<p>He tipped forward, not because his
feet made any noise. Once again,
nearer, that marvellous music rang past
him, echoing on into the woods. Then
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
it ceased; and as Webster approached
the field fence what he saw was a rabbit
watching him over the grass tops until
with long soft leaps it escaped through
the fence to the safety of the field.</p>

<p>For a while he remained leaning on
this fence and looking out across the
coming harvest. Twenty yards away a
clump of alders was in bloom: some
bird was singing out there joyously. It
made a <i>che che che</i> sound, also; but its
colour was brown.</p>

<p>The idea occurred to Webster that
he would recross the pasture to the
field on the other side and go on to the
turnpike: one ran there, for he heard
vehicles passing. He would make inquiry
about some piece of forest further
from the city. He remembered
again what the professor told them:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some of you this summer during
your vacation may go out to some
nearby strip of woods&mdash;what little is
left of the old forest&mdash;in quest of the
warbler. Seek the wildest spots you
can find. The Kentucky bluegrass
landscape is thin and tame now, but
there are places of thick undergrowth
where the bird still spends his Kentucky
summer. Shall I give you my
own experience as to where I found
him when a boy half a century ago?
On my father's farm there was a woodland
pasture. The land dipped there
into a marshy hollow. In this hollow
was a stock pond. Around the edges
of the pond grew young cane. It was
always low because the cattle browsed
it. The highest stalks were scarcely
five feet. On the edge of the canebrake
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
a thicket of papaw and blackberry
vines added rankness and forest secrecy.
It was here I discovered him. The
pale green and yellow of his plumage
blent with the pale green and yellow
of the leaves and stalks. But it was
many years before I knew that the
bird I had found was the Kentucky
warbler. If I had only known it when
I was a boy!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Webster reached the turnpike
and looked up and down, no one was
in sight. He sat on the fence and
waited. By and bye, coming in from
the country, a spring wagon appeared.
Curious projections stuck out from the
top and sides of boxes in the wagon.
When it drew nearer Webster saw
poultry being taken to market. He
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
looked at the driver but let him pass
unaccosted: there would be little use
in applying for information about warblers
at headquarters for broilers.</p>

<p>Next from the direction of the city
he saw coming a splendid open carriage
drawn by a splendid horse and
driven by a very pompous coloured
coachman in livery. An aristocratic
old lady sat in the carriage, shielding
her face from the dazzling sunlight with
a rich parasol. She leaned out and
looked curiously at Webster.</p>

<p>"Suydam," she called out to her
coachman with a voice that had the
faded sweetness of faded rose leaves,
"did you notice that remarkable boy?
He looked as though he would have
liked to drive with me out into the
country. I wish I had invited him to
do so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>A milk cart followed with a great
noise of tin cans. With milk carts
Webster felt somewhat at home: it
was often his business to receive the
family milk. As the cart was passing,
he motioned for the milkman to stop.
Perhaps all milkmen stop at any sign:
there may be an order: Webster called
out with a good deal of hesitation:</p>

<p>"Do you know of a woods further
out full of bushes and thickets?"</p>

<p>The milkman gave a little flap of
the rein to his horse:</p>

<p>"What's the matter with <i>you</i>?" he
said with patient forbearance:</p>

<p>Finally Webster saw creeping down
the turnpike toward him an empty
wagon-bed drawn by a yoke of oxen.
A good-natured young negro man sat
sideways on the wagon-tongue, smoking.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Webster halted him by a gesture
and a voice of command:</p>

<p>"Do you know of a bushy woods
further out?"</p>

<p>Any negro enjoys being questioned
because he enjoys not answering questions.
Most of all he enjoys any puzzling
exercise of his mother wit.</p>

<p>"A bushy woods?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a bushy woods."</p>

<p>"What do you want with a bushy
woods?"</p>

<p>"I want to find where there is one."</p>

<p>The negro hesitated: "there's a
bushy woods about four miles out."</p>

<p>"Is it on the pike?"</p>

<p>"On the pike! Did you ever see a
bushy woods on the pike? It's <i>beside</i>
the pike."</p>

<p>"Right side or left side?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Depends which way you're going.
Right side if you are going out, left
side if you're coming in."</p>

<p>"You say it's four miles out?"</p>

<p>"You pass the three mile post and
then you go a little further."</p>

<p>"Are there any birds in it?"</p>

<p>"Birds? There's owls in it. There's
coons in it."</p>

<p>"Do you know a young canebrake
when you see one?"</p>

<p>"I know an old hempbrake when I
see one."</p>

<p>Webster enjoyed his new authority
in holding up his negro and questioning
him about a forest. And it seemed to
him that the moment had come when
it was right to use money if you had it,
horns or no horns. He pulled out a
dime. The negro, too surprised to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
speak, came across and received it.
He declined to express thanks but felt
disposed to show that he had earned
the money by repeating a piece of information:</p>

<p>"It's four miles out."</p>

<p>"Is there much of it?"</p>

<p>"Much of it? Much as you want."</p>

<p>"Do you live in it?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't live in it: I live in a
house."</p>

<p>He had retaken his seat on the
wagon-tongue.</p>

<p>"What kind of pipe stem is that you
are using?"</p>

<p>"What kind? It's a cane pipe stem."</p>

<p>"Where did you get the cane?"</p>

<p>"Where did I get it? I got it in the
woods."</p>

<p>"Then there <i>is</i> young cane growing
in the woods?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who said there wasn't?"</p>

<p>Webster, beginning this morning to
use his eyes, took notice of something
which greatly interested him as the
wagon moved slowly off down the
pike: strands of hemp clung to it here
and there like a dry hanging moss.
The geologist had told them that his
own boyhood lay far back in the era
of great Kentucky hemp-raising. Much
of the hemp was broken in March, the
month of high winds. As the hemp-breakers
busily shook out their handfuls
while separating the fibre from
the shard, strands were carried away
on the roaring gales, lodging against
stubble and stumps and fences of the
fields or blown further on into the
pastures. Later when it was baled
and hauled in, other filaments were
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
caught on the rafters and shingles of
hemp-houses and barns. Thus when
in April the northward migration of
birds reached Kentucky, this material
was everywhere ready and plentiful,
and the Baltimore orioles on the bluegrass
plateau built their long hanging
nests of Kentucky hemp.</p>

<p>Webster, sitting on the fence and
thinking of this, meantime laid his
plans for the larger adventure of the
following day: the clue he sought had
unexpectedly been found: he would go
out to the place where young cane
grew: there he might have a real
chance at the warbler.</p>

<p>This being settled to his satisfaction,
he hurried impatiently back to his
woodland pasture. It had seemed empty
of living creatures when he entered
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
it; soon it had revealed itself as a whole
teeming world. The mere green carpet
of the woods was one vast birthplace
and nursery, concert hall, playground,
battlefield, slaughter-pen,
cemetery.</p>

<p>"But my ignorance!" he complained.
"I have good strong eyes, but all these
years they have been required to look
at dead maps, dead books, dead pencils
and figures, dead everything: not
once in all that time have they been
trained upon the study of a living
object."</p>

<p>His ears were as ignorant as his eyes:
he had not been educated to hear and
to know what he heard. Innumerable
strange sounds high and low beat incessantly
on them&mdash;wave upon wave
of louder and fainter melodies, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
summer music of the intent and earnest
earth. And everywhere what fragrances!
The tonic woody smells! Each
deep breath he drew laved his lungs
with sun-clean, leaf-sweet atmosphere.
Hour after hour of this until his whole
body and being&mdash;sight, smell, hearing,
mind and spirit&mdash;became steeped in
the forest joyousness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now it was alone in the June woods
that long bright afternoon that Webster
took final account of the last wonderful
things the geologist had told
them that memorable morning. He
pondered those sayings as best he
could, made out of them what he could:</p>

<div class="block1">
<p>"<i>I am not afraid to trust you, the
young, with big ideas which will lift your
minds as on strong wings and carry them
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
swiftly and far through time and space.
If you are taught to look for great things
early in life, you will early learn how to
find great things; and the things you love
to find will be the things you will desire
and try to do. I wish not to give you a
single trivial, mean weak thought.</i>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"<i>The Kentucky warbler for over a hundred
years has worn the name of the State
and has carried it all over the world&mdash;leading
the students of bird life to form
some image of a far country and to fix
their thoughts at least for some brief moment
on this same beautiful spot of the
world's surface. As long as he remains
in the forests of the earth, he will keep the
name of Kentucky alive though all else it
once meant shall have perished and been
forgotten. He is thus, as nearly as anything
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
in Nature can be, its winged worldwide
emblem, ever young as each spring
is young, as the green of the woods is
young.</i>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"<i>Study the warbler while you may:
how long he will inhabit the Kentucky
forest no one can tell. As civilisation
advances upon the forest, the wild species
retreat; when the forest falls, the wild
species are gone. Every human generation
during these centuries has a last look
at many things in Nature. No one will
ever see them again: Nature can never
find what she has once lost: if it is gone,
it is gone forever. What Wilson records
he saw of bird life in Kentucky a hundred
years ago reads to us now as fables of the
marvellous, of the incredible. Were he
the sole witness, some of us might think
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
him to be a lying witness. Let me tell you
that I in my boyhood&mdash;half a century
later than Wilson's visit to Kentucky&mdash;beheld
things that you will hardly believe.
The vast oak forest of Kentucky
was what attracted the passenger pigeon.
In the autumn when acorns were ripe but
not yet fallen, the pigeons filled the trees
at times and places, eating them from the
cups. Walking quietly some sunny afternoon
through the bluegrass pastures, you
might approach an oak and see nothing
but the tree itself, thick boughs with the
afternoon sunlight sparkling on the leaves
along one side. As you drew nearer, all
at once, as if some violent explosion had
taken place within the tree, a blue smoke-like
cloud burst out all around the treetop&mdash;the
simultaneous explosive flight
of the frightened pigeons. Or all night
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
long there might be wind and rain and
the swishing of boughs and the tapping
of loosened leaves against the window
panes; and when you stepped out of
doors next morning, it had suddenly become
clear and cold. Walking out into
the open and looking up at the clear sky
you might see this: an arch of pigeons
breast by breast, wing-tip to wing-tip,
high up in the air as the wild geese fly,
slowly moving southward. You could not
see the end of the arch on one horizon or
the other: the whole firmament was
spanned by that mighty arch of pigeons
flying south from the sudden cold. Not
all the forces in Nature can ever restore
that morning sunlit arch of pigeons flying
south. The distant time may come, or
a nearer, when the Kentucky warbler
will have vanished like the wild pigeon:
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
then any story of him will be as one of
the ancient fables of bird life.</i>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"<i>The rocks of the earth are the one
flooring on which every thing develops its
story, then either disappears upon the
stillness of the earth's atmosphere or
sinks toward the silence of its rocks.
Of the myriad forms of life on the earth
the bird has always been the one thing
nearest to what we call the higher life of
the human species.</i></p>

<p>"<i>It is the form and flight of the bird
alone that has given man at last the mastery
of the atmosphere. Without the bird
as a living model we have not the slightest
reason to believe that he could have ever
learned the mechanism of flight. Now
it is the flight of the bird, studied under
the American sky, that has given the</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
nations the war engine that will perhaps
rule the destiny of the human race henceforth.
<i>The form of the bird will fly before
our autumn-brown American armies
as they cross the sea&mdash;leading them
as the symbol of their victory. When
they lie along the trenches of France as
thick as fallen brown autumn leaves in
woodland hollows, it will be the flight of
bird-like emblems of destruction that
will guide them like hurricane-rushing
leaves as they sweep toward their evil
enemy.</i>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"<i>Through all ages the flight of the
bird alone has been the interpreter of the
human spirit. The living, standing on
the earth and seeing the souls of their dead
pass beyond their knowledge, have fixed
upon the bird as the symbol of their faith.

When you are old enough, if not already,
to know your Shakespeare, you will find
in one line of one of his plays the whole
vast human farewell of the living to the
dead: they are the words of Horatio to
Hamlet, his dying prince: 'the flights of
angels sing thee to thy rest.'</i>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"<i>As far as we geologists know, this
is the morning of the planet. Not its
dawn but somewhere near its sunrise.
The bird music we hear in these human
ages are morning songs. Back of that
morning stretches the earth's long dawn;
and the rocks tell us that thrushes were
singing in the green forests of the earth
millions of years before man had been
moulded of the dust and had awakened
and begun to listen to them. Thus bird
music which seems to us so fresh is the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
oldest music of the earth&mdash;millions of
years older than man's. And yet all this
is still but a morning song. The earth is
young, the birds are young, man is
young&mdash;all young together at the morning
of the earth's geologic day. What
the evening will be we do not know. It
is possible that the birds will be singing
their evening song to the earth and man
already have vanished millions of years
before.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Many questions vex us: all others lead
to one: when man vanishes, does he pass
into the stillness of the earth's atmosphere
and sink toward the stillness of its rocks
like every other species? He answers
with his faith: that his spirit is here he
knows not why, but takes flight from it he
knows not how or whither. Only, faith
discloses to him one picture: the snowy
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
pinion folded and at rest in the Final
Places.</i>"</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That long sunny afternoon in the
June woods! The shadows of the trees
slowly lengthened eastward. The sun
sank below the forest boughs and
shot its long lances against the tree
trunks. It made a straight path of
gold, deeper gold, across the yellow
grain. The sounds of life died away,
the atmosphere grew sweeter with
the odours of leaves and grasses and
blossoms.</p>

<p>Webster recrossed the woods as he
had entered it, waded through the
nightshade and climbed the fence under
the dark tree.</p>

<p>It was twilight when he entered the
City.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>As he passed her yard, Jenny bounded
across to him joyous, innocent, tender,
in a white frock with fresh blue
ribbons in her brown hair.</p>

<p>"Did you find him?" she asked, her
happiness not depending on his answer.</p>

<p>"It was not the right place. Tomorrow
I am going out further into the
country to a better place."</p>

<p>"The humming-bird has been here,"
Jenny announced with an air of saying
that she had been more successful as a
naturalist.</p>

<p>He made no reply: as the veteran
observer of a day, he had somewhat
outgrown the trumpet-vine arbour and
the ruby-throat.</p>

<p>He lingered close to the fence. Jenny
lingered. He moved off, disappointed
but devoid of speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come back!" Jenny whispered,
with reproach and vexation.</p>

<p>It was the first invitation. It was
the first acceptance of an invitation.
There would have been a second acceptance
but the invitation was not
there to accept.</p>

<p>When Webster turned in at his home
gate, everything was just as he had
foreseen: his father sat on one side of the
porch, smoking the one daily cigar; his
mother faced him from the opposite
side, slowly rocking. Elinor crouched
on the top step between them: he would
have to walk around her or over her.</p>

<p>His father laughed heartily as he
sauntered up.</p>

<p>"Well, my son, where is your game
bag? What have you brought us for
breakfast?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Webster looked crestfallen: he returned
empty-handed but not empty-minded:
he had had a great rich
day; they thought it an idle wasted
one.</p>

<p>"Some of the boys have been here
for you," said his mother. "They left
word you must be certain to meet them,
in the morning for the game. Freshen
yourself up and I'll give you your supper."</p>

<p>Elinor said nothing&mdash;a bad sign with
her. She sat with her sharp little chin
resting on her palms and with her eyes
on him with calculating secrecy. He
stepped around her.</p>

<p>His room had never seemed so
cramped after those hours in the
woods under the open sky. The whole
cottage seemed so unnatural, everything
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
in the City so unnatural, after
that day in the forest.</p>

<p>At supper he had not much to say;
his mother talked to him:</p>

<p>"I put my berries away to eat with
you for company." They ate their
berries together.</p>

<p>He felt tired and said he would go to
bed. His room was darkened when he
returned to it; he felt sure he had left
his lamp burning; someone had been
in it. He lighted his lamp again.</p>

<p>As he started toward his window to
close the shutters, his eye caught sight
of an object hanging from the window
sash. A paper was pinned around it.
The handwriting was Elinor's. It was
a bluejay, brought down by a lucky
stone from some cottager's hand. Webster
read Elinor's message for him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="i1">"Your favourite Kentucky Warbler,</p>

<p class="i2">From your old friend,</p>
<p class="i3">Thomas Jefferson."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He sat on the side of his bed. The
sights and sounds and fragrances of the
pasture were all through him; the sunlight
warmed his blood still, the young
blood of perfect health.</p>

<p class="pmb3">He turned in for the night and sleep
drew him away at once from reality.
And some time during the night he
awoke out of his sleep to the reality of a
great dream.</p>

</span>t was in the depths of a
wonderful forest, green
with summer and hoary
with age. He was sitting
on the ground in a small open space.
No path led to this or away from it, but
all around him grew grasses and plants
which would be natural coverts for wild
creatures. No human tread had ever
crushed those plants.</p>

<p>The soft vivid light resting on the
woods was not morning-light nor evening-light:
it was clear light without the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
hours. Yet the time must have been
near noonday; for as Webster looked
straight up toward the unseen sky,
barred from his eyes by the forest roof
of leaves, slender beams of sunlight
filtered perpendicularly down, growing
mistier as they descended until they
could be traced no longer even as luminous
vapour; no palest radiance from
them reached the grass.</p>

<p>He could not see far in any direction.
At the edge of the open space where he
sat, fallen rotten trees lay amid the
standing live ones&mdash;parents, grandparents,
great-grandparents of the rising
forest, passing back into the soil of
the planet toward the rocks.</p>

<p>Strange as was the spot, stranger
was Webster to himself and did not
know what had changed him. It
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
seemed that for the first time in his life
his eyes were fully opened; never had
he seen with such vision; and his feeling
was so deep, so intense. The whole
scene was enchantment. It was more
than reality. <i>He</i> was more than reality.
The singing of birds far away&mdash;it
was so crystal sweet, yet he could see
none. A few yards from him a rivulet
made its way from somewhere to somewhere.
He could trace its course by
the growth of plants which crowded
its banks and covered it with their
leaves.</p>

<p>Expectancy weighed heavily on him.
He was there for a purpose but could
not say what the purpose was.</p>

<p>All at once as his eyes were fixed on
the low, green thicket opposite him, he
saw that it was shaken; something was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
on its way to him. He watched the
top of the thicket being parted to the
right and to the left. With a great
leaping of his heart he waited, motionless
where he sat on the grass. What
creature could be coming? Then he
saw just within the edge of the thicket
a curious piece of head-gear&mdash;he had
no knowledge of any such hat. Then
he saw a gun barrel. Then the hand
and forearm of a man was thrust forward
and it pushed the underbrush
aside; and then there stepped forth into
the open the figure of a hunter, lean,
vigorous, tall, athletic. The hunter
stepped out with a bold stride or two
and stopped and glanced eagerly around
with an air of one in a search; he discovered
Webster and with a look of
relief stood still and smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>There could be no mistake. Webster
held imprinted on memory from a picture
those features, those all-seeing
eyes; it was Wilson&mdash;weaver lad of
Paisley, wandering peddler youth of the
grey Scotch mountains, violinist, flutist,
the poet who had burned his poem
standing in the public cross, the exile,
the school teacher for whom the boy
caught the mouse, the failure who sent
the drawing to Thomas Jefferson, the
bold figure in the skiff drifting down the
Ohio&mdash;the naturalist plunging into the
Kentucky wilderness and walking to
Lexington and shivering in White's garret&mdash;the
great American ornithologist,
the immortal man.</p>

<p>There he stood: how could it be? It
was reality yet more than reality.</p>

<p>The hunter walked straight toward
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
him with the light of recognition in his
eyes. He came and stood before Webster
and looked down at him with a
smile:</p>

<p>"Have you found him, Webster?"</p>

<p>Webster strangely heard his own
voice:</p>

<p>"I have not found him."</p>

<p>"You have looked long?"</p>

<p>"I have looked everywhere and I
cannot find him."</p>

<p>The hunter sat down and laid on the
grass beside him his fowling piece, his
game bag holding new species of birds,
and his portfolio of fresh drawings.
Then he turned upon Webster a searching
look as if to draw the inmost truth
out of him and asked:</p>

<p>"Why do you look for the Kentucky
Warbler?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Webster hesitated long:</p>

<p>"I do not know," he faltered.</p>

<p>"Something in you makes you seek
him, but you do not know what that
something is?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not know what it is: I
know I wish to find him."</p>

<p>"Not him alone but many other
things?"</p>

<p>"Yes, many other things."</p>

<p>"The whole wild life of the forest?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all the wild things in the forest&mdash;and
the wild forest itself."</p>

<p>"You wish to know about these
things&mdash;you wish to know them?"</p>

<p>"I wish to know them."</p>

<p>The hunter searched Webster's countenance
more keenly, more severely:</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>There was silence. The forest was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
becoming more wonderful. The singing
of the unseen birds more silvery
sweet. It was beyond all reality. Webster
answered:</p>

<p>"I am sure."</p>

<p>The hunter hurled questions now
with no pity:</p>

<p>"Would you be afraid to stay here
all night alone?"</p>

<p>"I would not."</p>

<p>"If, during the night, a storm should
pass over the forest with thunder
deafening you and lightning flashing
close to your eyes and trees falling
everywhere, you would fear for your life
and that would be natural and wise;
but would you come again?"</p>

<p>"I would."</p>

<p>"If it were winter and the forest
were bowed deep with ice and snow
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
and you were alone in it, having lost
your way, would you cry enough?
Would you hunt for a fireside and never
return?"</p>

<p>"I would not."</p>

<p>"You can stand cold and hunger and
danger and fatigue; can you be patient
and can you be persevering?"</p>

<p>"I can."</p>

<p>"Look long and not find what you
look for and still not give up?"</p>

<p>"I can."</p>

<p>There was silence for a little while:
the mood of the hunter seemed to
soften:</p>

<p>"Do you know where you are, Webster?"</p>

<p>"I do not know where I am."</p>

<p>"You did not know then, that this
is the wilderness of your forefathers&mdash;the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Kentucky pioneers. You have
wandered back to it."</p>

<p>"I did not know."</p>

<p>"Have you read their great story?"</p>

<p>"Not much of it."</p>

<p>"Are you beginning to realise what
it means to be sprung from such men
and women?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say."</p>

<p>"But you want to do great things?"</p>

<p>"If I loved them."</p>

<p>The hunter stood up and gathered
his belongings together. His questions
had become more kind as though he
were satisfied. He struck Webster
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"<i>Come</i>," he said, as with high trust,
"<i>I will show you the Kentucky warbler.</i>"</p>

<p>He looked around and his eyes fell
upon the forest brook. He walked over
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
to it, to discover in what direction it
ran and beckoned.</p>

<p>"We'll follow this stream up: the
spring may not be far away." He
glanced at the tree-tops: "It is nearly
noon: the bird will come to the spring
to drink and to bathe."</p>

<p>Webster followed the hunter as he
threaded his way through the forest
toward the source of the brook.</p>

<p>Not many yards off his guide turned:</p>

<p>"There is the spring," he said, pointing
to a green bank out of which
bubbled the cool current.</p>

<p>"Let us sit here. Make no movement
and make no noise."</p>

<p>How tense the stillness! They waited
and listened. Finally the hunter spoke
in an undertone:</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Away off in the forest Webster heard
the song of a bird. Presently it came
nearer. Now it was nearer still. It
sounded at last within the thicket just
above the spring, clear, sweet, bold,
emphatic notes distinctly repeated at
short intervals. And then&mdash;</p>

<p><i>There he was&mdash;the Kentucky Warbler!</i></p>

<p>Webster could see every mark of
identification. The bird had come out
of the dense growth and showed himself
on the bough of a sapling about
twenty feet from the earth, in his grace
and shapeliness and manly character.
With a swift, gliding flight downward
he lighted on a sweeping limb of a tree
still nearer, within a few inches of the
ground. Then he dropped to the
ground and moved about, turning over
dead leaves. He was only several
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
yards away and Webster could plainly
trace the yellow line over his eye, the
blackish crown and black sides of the
throat, the underparts all of solid yellowish
gold, the upper parts of olive
green. An instant later the bird was
on the wing again, hither, thither, up
and down, continually in motion. No
white in the wings, none in the tail
feathers. Once he stopped and poured
out his loud, musical song&mdash;unlike any
other warbler's. A moment later he
was on the ground again, with a manner
of self-possession, dignity&mdash;as on
his namesake soil, Kentucky.</p>

<p>Webster had sat bent over toward
him, forgetful of everything else. At
last drawing a deep breath, he looked
around gratefully, remembering his
guide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>No one was near him. Webster saw
the hunter on the edge of the thicket
yards away; he stood looking back, his
figure dim, fading. Webster, forgetful
of the bird, cried out with quick pain:</p>

<p>"Are you going away? Am I never
to see you again?"</p>

<p>The voice that reached him seemed
scarcely a voice; it was more like an
echo, close to his ear, of a voice lost
forever:</p>

</span>ebster sprang to his feet
in the depths of the strange
summer-dark forest: that
is to say, he awoke with a
violent start and found himself sitting
on his bed with his feet hanging over
one side.</p>

<p>It was late to be getting up. The sun
already soared above the roof of the
cottage opposite his window and the
light slanted in full blaze against his
shutters. Shafts penetrated some
weather-loosened slats and fell on his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
head and shoulders and on the wall
behind him. Breakfast must be nearly
ready. Fresh cooking odours&mdash;coffee
odour, meat odour, bread odour&mdash;filled
the little bathroom-bedroom. Feet were
hurrying, scurrying, in the kitchen.
Quieter footsteps approached his door
along the narrow hall outside and there
came a tap:</p>

<p>"Breakfast, Webster!"</p>

<p>It was his mother's voice, indulgent,
peaceful, sweet. He suddenly thought
that never before had he fully realised
how sweet it was, had always been, notwithstanding
he disappointed her.</p>

<p>He got up and went across to open
his shutters and had taken hold of the
catch, when he was arrested in his
movement. At night he tilted the
shutters, so that the morning sun
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
might not enter crevices and shine
in his face and awaken him. Now
looking down through the slats, he
discovered something going on in the
yard beneath his window. Elinor had
come tipping around the corner of
the cottage. She held one dark little
witch-like finger unconsciously pressed
against her tense lips. Her dark eyes
were brimming with a secret, mischievous
purpose. A ribbon which looked
like a huge, crumpled purple morning-glory
was knotted into the peak of her
ravenish hair. Her fresh little gown,
too, suggested the colours of the purple
morning-glory and her whole presence,
with a freshness as of dew-drops formed
amid moonbeams at midnight, somehow
symbolised that flower which
surprises us at dawn as having matured
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
its unfolding in the dark: half sinister,
half innocent.</p>

<p>With cautious, delicate steps, which
could not possibly have made any noise
in the grass, she approached the window
and stopped and lifted the notched
pole which was used to hold up the
clothes-line in the back yard. Setting
the pole on end and planting herself
beside it, she pushed it with all her
slight but concentrated strength against
the window shutters. It struck violently
and fell over to the grass in one
direction as Elinor, with the silence of
a light wind, fled in the other.</p>

<p>Webster stood looking down at it all:
he understood now: that was the crashing
sound which had awakened him.</p>

<p>It had been Elinor who had ended
his dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>But his dream was not ended. It
would never end. It was in him to
stay and it was doing its work. The
feeling which had surprised him as to
the sweetness of his mother's voice but
marked the deeper awakening that
had taken place in his sleep, an unfolding,
his natural growth. It was this
growth that now animated him as he
smiled at Elinor's flying figure. Her
prank had not irritated him: no intrigue
of hers would ever annoy him
again. Instead, the idea struck him
that Elinor must be thinking of him
a great deal, if so much of her life&mdash;incessantly
active as it was with the
other children of the cottages&mdash;were
devoted to plans to worry him. She
must often have him in mind quite to
herself, he reflected; and this fresh
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
picture of Elinor's secret brooding
about him somehow for the first time
touched him tenderly and finely.</p>

<p>He turned back from the window
shutters without opening them and
sat on the edge of his bed. He could
not shake off his dream. How could
it possibly be true that there was no
such forest as he had wandered into
in his dream&mdash;that Kentucky wilderness
of the old heroic days? Could
anything destroy in him the certainty
that with wildly beating heart he had
seen the living colours and heard the
actual notes and watched the characteristic
movements of the warbler?
Then, though these things were not
real, still they were true and would remain
true always.</p>

<p>Thus, often and to many of us, between
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
closing the curtains of the eyes
upon the outer world at night and
drawing them wide in the morning,
within that closed theatre a stage has
been erected and we have stepped forth
and spoken some solitary part or played
a r&ocirc;le in a drama that leaves us changed
for the rest of our days. Yesterday an
old self, today a new self. We have
been shifted completely away from
our last foot-prints and our steps move
off in another direction, taking a truer
course.</p>

<p>Beyond all else a high, solemn sense
subdued Webster with the thought,
that in his sleep he had come near as to
unearthly things. The long-dead hunter,
who had appeared to him, spoke as
though he lived elsewhere than on the
earth and lived more nobly; his accents,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the majesty of his countenance, were
moulded as by higher wisdom and
goodness. Webster was overwhelmed
with the feeling that he had been
brought near the mystery of life and
death and as from an immortal spirit
had received his consecration to the
forest.</p>

<p>... He got down on his knees at his
bedside, after a while, though little
used to prayer....</p>

<p>When he walked into the breakfast-room
with a fresh step and freshened
countenance, probably all were not
slow to notice the change. Families
whose lives run along the groove of
familiar routine quickly observe the
slightest departure from the customary,
whether in voice or behaviour, of
any member. There was response soon
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
after his entrance to something in him
obviously unusual.</p>

<p>"My son," said his father, who had
laid down his paper to help him to the
slice which had been put aside, "the
woods must agree with you"; and he
even scraped the dish for a little extra
gravy. Ordinarily, when deeply interested
in his paper or occasionally
when conscious of some disappointment
as to his son, he forgot, or was indifferent
about, the gravy.</p>

<p>"They do agree with me!" Webster
replied, laughing and in fresh tones.
He held out his plate hungrily for his
slice and he waited for all the gravy
that might be coming to him.</p>

<p>"One of the boys has already been
here this morning," said his mother,
handing him his cup. "They want you
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
to be sure to meet them this afternoon,
not to fail. You must have been dead
asleep, for I called you at three different
times."</p>

<p>"Did you knock three times?"</p>

<p>Webster asked his question with a
sinking of the heart; what if his mother's
first knock had awakened him?
He might never have finished his dream,
might never have dreamed at all. How
different the morning might have
been, how different the world&mdash;if his
mother had awakened him before his
dream!</p>

<p>He received his cup from her and
smiled at her:</p>

<p>"I was dreaming," he said, and he
smiled also at the safety of his vision.</p>

<p>Elinor, sitting opposite him, had
said nothing. She had finished her
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
breakfast before he had come in and
plainly lingered till he should enter.
Since his entrance she had sat restless
in her chair, toying with her fork or her
napkin, and humming significantly to
herself. She had this habit. "You
must not sing at the table, Elinor," her
mother had once said. "I am <i>not</i> singing,"
Elinor had replied, "I am humming
to myself, and <i>no</i> one is supposed
to listen." Meantime this morning, her
quickly shifting eyes would sweep his
face questioningly; she must have been
waiting for some sign as to what had
been the effect of the Thomas Jefferson
bluejay the night before and of the
repeated attack on his window shutters.</p>

<p>Often when out of humour with her
he had declined to notice her at table;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
now once, when he caught her searching
glance, he smiled. Dubiously, half
with disbelief and half with amazement,
she looked steadily back at him
for an instant; then she slipped confusedly
from her seat and was gone.
Webster laughed within himself: "what
will she be up to next?" he thought.</p>

<p>It was quiet now at the table: his
father had gone back to his paper, his
mother was eating the last of her
breakfast fruit, and perhaps, thinking
that out in the country things were
getting ripe. After an interval Webster
broke the silence: he was white
with emotion.</p>

<p>"Father," he said quietly, "I have
decided what I'd like to do."</p>

<p>Webster's father dropped his paper:
Webster's mother's eyes were on him.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
The years had waited for this moment,
the future depended upon it.</p>

<p>"If you and mother do not need me
for anything else just yet, I'd like to
work my way through the University.
But if there's something different you'd
rather I'd do, or if you both want me
in any other way, I am here."</p>

<p>"My son," exclaimed his father,
rudely with the back of his hand brushing
away a tear that rolled down his
cheek&mdash;a tear perhaps started by something
in his son's words that brought
back his own hard boyhood, "your
father is here to work for you as long
as he is alive and able. Your mother
and I are glad&mdash;!" but he, got no further:
his eyes had filled and his voice
choked him.</p>

<p>Webster's mother stood beside him,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
her hand on his head, her handkerchief
pressed to her eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he had made his preparations
for the glad day's adventure and
stepped out on the front porch, his
father had gone to the bank, his mother
was in the kitchen. Elinor was sitting
on the top step. Her back was turned.
Her sharp little elbows rested on her
knees and her face was propped in her
palms. Her figure again suggested a
crumpled, purple morning-glory&mdash;fragile,
not threatened by any human
violence but imperilled by nature.</p>

<p>She did not look around as he
stepped out or move as he passed down.
He felt a new wish to say something
pleasant but could not quite so conquer
himself. As he laid his hand on the yard
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
gate, he was stopped by these words,
reaching his ears from the porch:</p>

<p>"Take me with you!"</p>

<p>He could not believe his ears. Could
this be Elinor, his tease, his torment?
This wounded appeal, timid pleading&mdash;could
it proceed from Elinor? He
was thrown off his balance and too
surprised to act. The words were
repeated more beseechingly, wistfully:</p>

<p>"Take me with you, will you, Webster?"</p>

<p>For now that she had given herself
away to him, he might as well see
everything: that at last she was openly
begging that she be admitted to a share
in his plans and pleasures, that he no
longer disdain to play with her.</p>

<p>He spoke with rough embarrassment
over his shoulder:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can't go today. Nobody can
go today. I'm going miles out into
the country to the woods."</p>

<p>"But some day will you take me
over into the woods yonder?"</p>

<p>After a while he turned toward her:</p>

<p>"Yes, I will."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. Thank
you very much, indeed, Webster!"</p>

<p>The tide of feeling began to rush
toward her:</p>

<p>"There are some wild violets over
there, Elinor, wild blue violets and
wild white violets&mdash;thick beds of them
in the shade."</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely!" She clasped her
hands and knotted them tensely under
her chin and kept her eyes fixed more
hopefully on him.</p>

<p>"There is a flock of the funniest little
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
fairies dancing under one of the big
forest trees, each carrying the queerest
little green parasol."</p>

<p>"How perfectly, perfectly lovely!"</p>

<p>"And I found one little cedar tree.
If they'll let us, I'll dig it up and bring
it home and plant it in the front yard.
It will be your own cedar tree, Elinor."</p>

<p>"Oh, Webster! Could anything be
more lovely of you?"</p>

<p>"You and I and Jenny will go some
day soon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" cried Elinor, stamping
her feet fiercely and wringing her
hands. "I don't want Jenny to go!
I won't have Jenny! Just you and I!
Not Jenny! Just you and I!"</p>

<p>"Then just you and I," he said,
smiling at her and moving away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Wait!</i>"</p>

<p>She darted down the steps and ran
to him and drew his face over and laid
her cheek against his cheek, clinging
to him.</p>

<p>He struggled to get away, laughing
with his new happiness: tears welled
out of her eyes with hers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Webster had taken to the turnpike.</p>

<p>The morning was cool, the blue of
the sky vast, tender, noble. Rain during
the night had left the atmosphere
fresh and clear and the pike dustless.
Little knobs of the bluish limestone
jutted out. The greyish grass and
weeds on each side had been washed
till they looked green again.</p>

<p>The pike climbed a hill and from
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
this hilltop he turned and looked back.
He could see the packed outskirts of
the city and away over in the heart of
it church spires rising here and there.
The heart of it had once been the green
valley through which a stream of the
wilderness ran: there Wilson had seen
the water mills and the gallows for
hanging Kentuckians and the thousand
hitched horses and folks sitting
on the public square selling cakes of
maple sugar and split squirrels.</p>

<p>Soon he passed the pasture where
he had spent yesterday. That had
done well enough as a beginning: today
he would go further. He remembered
many things he had seen in the park-like
bluegrass woods. Sweet to his ear
sounded the call of bobwhite from the
yellow grain. He wondered whether
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the ailing young crows in the tree-tops
had at last taken all their medicine.
The curious bird which had watched
him out of a hole in the tree-trunk&mdash;the
chap with the black band across
his chest and the speckled jacket and
the red cap on the back of his head,
was he still on the lookout? What had
become of the gorgeous little velvet
coach that had travelled across the
back of his hand on its unknown road?
And that mystery of the high leaves&mdash;that
wandering disembodied voice:
<i>Se-u-re? Se-u-u.</i> Did it still haunt
the waving boughs?</p>

<p>But miles on ahead in the country,
undergrowth, shade, secrecy for wild
creatures&mdash;his heart leaped forward
to these and his feet hastened.</p>

<p>This day with both eyes open, not
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
shut in sleep, he might find the warbler.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Whole-heartedly, with a boy's eagerness,
Webster suddenly took off his
hat and ran down the middle of the
gleaming white turnpike toward the
green forest&mdash;toward all, whether much
or little, that he was ever to be.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
